## Preface  
  
Dear Friend,  

you are going to die some day.
This book is for you if  
there is something in the meantime
worth maximizing.  

### lesson-preface
lesson 1
how to read this book

The purpose of this book is for you to engage your life.

1-get a pencil and note the time in box A.

2-in box B, if you 
- did, put "2".
- didn't and felt, "will do, but first let me read on.", put "1".
- didn't and felt, "that's dumb, strike 1 for this book," put "0".

If you wrote 2, you hold curiosity enough to try new things,
or lie about it.
If you qualified as a 1, you imagine you have the curiosity, and
you will be right once you write down the time,
and you are a liar until this happens or you admit you qualify as a 0.
If 0 best represents your feeling, you could probably stop reading now, or admit you're a 1.

You can engage every word you read in this book with 0, 1, or 2.
The best thing you can do for me is share your numbers, whatever they are, including at what point your 0's felt like enough. 

The primary voice (COMM-STYLE) in this book is me as a 2 for assuming you're a 2. Further, I'm a 2 because what I write is testable, I've tried it, and I think it is better than alternative ways of dealing with the subject. This is radical "benefit of the doubt" regarding text (WORDS). 

A good consequence is this saves on many words of "justifying" why I'm telling you X or Y. I'm telling you because it is good, and you want to know what is good, and will minimally consider applying it to find out if it is good for you, and I would be ever so gracious if you shared with me what you determined after trying it.

The bad consequence is that it could seem a mystery if / why something is suggested. 
Why did I ask you to write down the time?
Because all of your life, the good and the bad, 
are most simply knowable, understandable, manipulable, in terms of time. 
The more you know how your life, your meaning, etc., 
relate to time, the more you understand your life, 
and have a chance to do something about it.
In this case, you now have 
a rough estimate of when you started reading this book.
It is a bookmark in your life. A moment.
It tells you nothing on its own,
but as things happen at later times,
it gives you a comparison point.
When you finish the book, when you started acting differently, when you started feeling better, etc.

The numbering system is explained more in "Reader." (ROLE-READER)


### logistics
The book is organized into 
parts. 

Part One 
deals with the existential facts of life:
you experience it, and you have some control over it.
By bringing process and analysis to the thoughts
underlying your control,
you can investigate, change, and optimize 
the actions that most greatly improve your experiences.

To do so 
with expectations modest and robust enough
for most people to
responsibly and effectively benefit,
would be a fitting, improved "goal"
of the pedagogy of 
a mature education system.

As such,
part one deals with the facts of life
framed as an object of study
for a novice student.

It includes lessons
as examples
of how various challenges in life
may be intellectualized
for the benefit of the individual
without imposing an external value system.

The process of learning is called
SKILLED REFLECTION.
The idealized environment and learning culture
is called
the INTELLECTUAL BOOTCAMP.
Don't overthink these frames,
unless you're prepared to get dirty.

While life is about a physical relationship
with the world,
it is thoughts that have the power to change
the quality of life.
Words are as close as we can practically get
to investigating thoughts.

In plain words, Part Two deals with
the pros and cons of WORDS,
their common uses,
and a better way of engaging them,
for the purposes of
optimizing goals.

Without spelling out all the flaws,
Part two analyzes
the nature of limitations of words
and proposes lines of investigation
and revision to lead to better word use.

The key arguments are radical application of:
- brevity
- value-assessing
- clarity 

These are accomplished with concrete guidance on actions.

Figure 1 highlights key IDEAS and 
their basic associations,
to reduce potential confusion with lay-definitions.

Thanks to
the first student of the boot camp, 
who bet to publish the first edition.  

Thanks to those who didn't read it,
especially Nick and Bill,
to inspire me to write a second edition,
quickly, more brief and clear.

These will appear throughout in capital letters, and 
are thoroughly explored in Part Two.
