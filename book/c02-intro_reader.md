A perfect human is one
who sees their destination
as clear as the sun on the horizon,
able-bodied to get there.

This framework considers
two interrelated ideals:
a FIT self with WIT.

Your intention is to be FIT for 
the actions your body and the world requires,
and WIT to decide what's required,
and act accordingly.

Everything I write is meant plainly.   
simply pay attention.   

If you get confused, forget it, 
pay attention to right now.  
  
Our goal here is thinking.   
Thinking happens in your heads.   
In order to do something about it,   
we need to think on paper.  
  
You'll get good at thinking.
[but not because of your attention]

attention is not reliable.   
The clock is. 
The clock is a cue to think.  
When it goes off, 
get back on task (pay attention).  
  
READER, there is 
some truth in you,
and some bull.

Much of the bull you can
discover and remedy
by paying attention to
the Truth in you.
Skilled Reflection is designed
to optimize this process.
You'll need peers or an instructor
for the remainder. (Part two)

As an action,
READING can feel 
boring or difficult.
To remedy this, 
consider reframing reading as
having an implicit dialog with the author.
Here, the author is defenseless to your critiques,
and you are defenseless to the direction of the conversation.
To make the most of it,
maximize your ability to listen
to the author,
and to yourself; your felt- and reasoned- responses.
You chose to be here,
so don't discount the self that 
believed opening the book was worthwhile.
