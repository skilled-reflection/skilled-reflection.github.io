Dear Friend,  

You are going to die some day.
This book is for you if 
there is something in the meantime
worth maximizing.  

## how to read this book

The purpose of this book is for you to engage your life.

1-get a pencil and note the date and time, here: \_\_\_\_\_\_-\_\_\_\_\_\_-\_\_\_\_\_\_ `YYYY-MMDD-HHMM`.

2-in this box, \_\_\_\_  
if you:  
- did 1, write "2". you either are curious enough to try new things,
or lie about it.
- didn't do 1 and felt, "will do, but first let me read on.", write "1". you imagine you have the curiosity, and
you will be right once you write down the time, 
and you are a liar until this happens or you admit you qualify as a 0.
- didn't do 1 and felt, "that's dumb, strike 1 for this book," write "0". you could probably stop reading now, or admit you're a "1".

You can engage every word you read in this book with 0, 1, or 2.  
The only reason to read anything is for its potential impact on your life.
Therefore, I write with the intention to make such decisions and impact easier.
That is, where possible, the language is direct, perscriptive and strong.

The primary voice (COMM-STYLE) in this book is me as a 2 for assuming you're a 2. Further, I'm a 2 because what I write is testable, I've tried it, and I think it is better than alternative ways of dealing with the subject. This is radical "benefit of the doubt" regarding text (WORDS). 

A good consequence is this saves on many words of "justifying" why I'm telling you X or Y. I'm telling you because it is good, and you want to know what is good, and will minimally consider applying it to find out if it is good for you, and I would be ever so gracious if you shared with me what you determined after trying it.

It is not that I do away with nuance, but 
that I hope you spend more time thinking about your OWN nuance,
than worrying about mine.
I posit an idea in "loud" terms,
and you identify the appropriate volume for your own truth.
More on this can be found in [words].

The bad consequence is that much is left between the lines. 
Why did I ask you to write down the time?

you now have 
a rough estimate of when you started reading this book.
It is a bookmark in your life. A moment.
It tells you nothing on its own,
but as things happen at later times,
it gives you a comparison point.
When you finish the book, 
when you started acting differently, 
when you started feeling better, etc.

The more you know how your life, your meaning, etc., 
relate to time, the more you understand your life, 
and have a chance to do something about it.


### camp homeless
I predict the most difficult part
of reading this book
is how uninteresting it seems,
a book that describes
obvious facts of life.
Very little should surprise you,
the reader engaged in simulating
what I describe,
because it
falls awfully close to reality.

So let me offer three hypotheticals
to help.

1. go camping
2. be homeless
3. try to write your own version of this book.

1. When you camp, you
overpack, 
are late,
and/or underprepared.

Yes, you are.*
You cannot give me a good reason
why planning and executing your life is fundamentally different.

*If you're a good camper,
you've learned from mistakes.
We don't have past lives 
to learn from.

The reason is a disconnect between
your mind's reality,
and the one you are physically acting in.
It can be described in many ways,
and all of them are versions of a single error:
miscalculation of time on task.
The most common version of this is
forgetting necessary subtasks for an intended task.
Another is that you simply don't do the things you think you will.
The result is you will die in two worlds,
the world you imagine you could have lived,
and the one you did.

Part one, 
the Garden, 
is a tool for remedying 
all the knowable versions of this problem.

#### be homeless  
The odds are you 
haven't been homeless,
but imagine the closest experience
you've had.
You couldn't find your car in the middle of winter,
or you went camping without waterproof gear and it rained.
In the first moments,
there is shock and terror,
frustration and suffering.
This is the power of your habit
protesting a change in plans.

In any environment,
even far into the spectrum of clear suffering,
if you spend enough time to get used to it,
that is, develop habits, acclimate,
then what you deem suffering
will shift. 

It is hard to describe how this might happen
for each individual for two reasons.
First, we're dealing with an unknown experience,
and second, we each carry a customized collection
of misattributions that I cannot predict for you.
Returning to the homeless situation,
suppose two things:
you are hungry, and food is what you need.
Then, imagine you have two choices to pursue:
food, or cake.
In your pre-homeless life,
often you can have food and cake,
but when it is a choice, you should choose food.
If you disagree 
change your answer above to a 1 or 0.
This book cannot help anyone
who values hypotheticals more than the practical truth.

To make sure you leave on time,
and are packed for the things that matter,
the most important thing you can do
is be clearer about your priorities.
Bare necessities at the top,
cake at the bottom,
and many hours of thinking and trying out,
to sort the in-between cases.

Extreme experiences, 
like being homeless or taking a cold shower,
can help clarify what really matters,
and what you can live without.

If, as most of us are,
we just cannot be bothered to test ourselves that way,
then I offer an alternative:
share and discuss your priorities with others.
This leverages the small ways
each of us live, "suffering" according to the next person,
as no two people's pris are identical.

Part two is 
a group of guidelines for
sharing ideas with the goal of 
identifying what matters.

The key arguments are radical application of:
- brevity
- value-assessing
- clarity 

These are accomplished with concrete guidance on actions.

Figure 1 highlights key IDEAS and 
their basic associations,
to reduce potential confusion with lay-definitions.

Thanks to
the first student of the boot camp, 
who bet to publish the first version.  

Thanks to those who didn't read it
to encourage me to revise.
May you find time to advocate your passions, too.

### Figure 1  
The relationship between core IDEAS of this book. 
These will appear throughout in capital letters. 
The first word in each row refers to a Chapter.  
  



## The Garden

The chapters on the Garden describe the key IDEAS of this book: the existential experience of being human--from the biological of eating and sleeping to thinking and meaning-making. The purpose is to illustrate the interdependence of mind and body (Garden-1), death and meaning (Garden-2), self and others (Garden-3).

"The Garden" is a description to be experienced. The purpose is for you to make
a Garden with the specifics of 
your own life, identity, and ambitions.
As a metaphor, the Garden helps foreground the things we often lose sight of when conceptualizing: life is brief and we are mortal.

Your ability to imagine your garden 
shows how the mental world 
can be strategic and powerful 
in bringing clarity to your reality. 
However, your mind can also be idealistic in ways that set you up for failure and suffering. 


### IDEAS and Plans  
The second part of each chapter
returns to reality.
"IDEAS and Plans" gives
clear, literal and concrete language 
to the key IDEAs and consequences (LINKs)
in "The Garden".

Definitions for IDEAS (ALL CAPS) are always 
describing some sense(s) of 
what you already know by the same name,
but LIMIT which relevant senses.
For example "WORK" is about careers,
but not 'yard work'.

Generally, this is to give
IDEAS measurable, consequential meaning.
See the chapters on WORDS 
for more.

You can read more about this in "PLANS"

A special case of plans is a LESSON.
The LESSONS are much like "The Garden",
meant to activate 
relevant parts of your reality or beliefs,
in a way that applies
the IDEAS introduced.
They are exercises that
take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete.
You can read more about them in "SR".
