Dear Friend,  

You are going to die some day.
This book is for you if 
there is something in the meantime
worth maximizing.  

## how to read this book

The purpose of this book is for you to engage your life.

1-get a pencil and note the date and time, here: \_\_\_\_\_\_-\_\_\_\_\_\_-\_\_\_\_\_\_ `YYYY-MMDD-HHMM`.

2-in this box, \_\_\_\_  
if you:  
- did 1, write "2". you either are curious enough to try new things,
or lie about it.
- didn't do 1 and felt, "will do, but first let me read on.", write "1". you imagine you have the curiosity, and
you will be right once you write down the time, 
and you are a liar until this happens or you admit you qualify as a 0.
- didn't do 1 and felt, "that's dumb, strike 1 for this book," write "0". you could probably stop reading now, or admit you're a "1".

The only reason to read anything is for its potential impact on your life.

The primary voice I assume is as a 2,
assuming you're a 2. 

I'm a 2 because I've tested what I write and I find it to be 
better than alternative ways of dealing with the subject. 
I'm telling you because it is good, and you want to know what is good, and will minimally consider applying it to find out if it is good for you.
Where possible, the language is direct, perscriptive and strong.
I write with the intention to make such decisions and impact easier.
You can engage every word you read in this book with 0, 1, or 2.  

Why did I ask you to write down the time?
you now have 
a rough estimate of when you started reading this book.
It is a bookmark in your life. A moment.
It tells you nothing on its own,
but as things happen at later times,
it gives you a comparison point.
When you finish the book, 
when you started acting differently, 
when you started feeling better, etc.

The more you know how your life, your meaning, etc., 
relate to time, the more you understand your life, 
and have a chance to do something about it.

### camp homeless
this book describes
obvious facts of life.
Very little should surprise you,
the reader engaged in simulating
what I describe,
because it
falls awfully close to reality.

So let me offer three hypotheticals
to help.

1. go camping
2. be homeless
3. try to write your own version of this book.

1. When you camp, you
overpack, 
are late,
and/or underprepared.

planning and executing your life is 
not fundamentally different.

If you're not unprepared or late to camp,
you've learned from mistakes.
We don't have past lives 
to learn from.

You are very likely late to your own life.

The reason is a disconnect between
your mind's reality,
and the one you are physically acting in.
It can be described in many ways,
and all of them are versions of a single error:
miscalculation of time on task.
The most common version of this is
forgetting necessary subtasks for an intended task.
Another is that you simply don't do the things you think you will.
The result is you will die in two worlds,
the world you imagine you could have lived,
and the one you did.

Part one, 
the Garden, 
is a tool for remedying 
all the knowable versions of this problem.

#### be homeless  
The odds are you 
haven't been homeless,
but imagine the closest experience
you've had.
You couldn't find your car in the middle of winter,
or you went camping without waterproof gear and it rained.
In the first moments,
there is shock and terror,
frustration and suffering.
Your habit
protests for a change in plans.

In any environment,
even far into the spectrum of clear suffering,
habits will acclimate in time.
what you call suffering
will change. 

Now, suppose you are hungry and
you have two choices to pursue:
food, or cake.
In your pre-homeless life,
often you can have food and cake,
but when it is a choice, you should choose food.
If you disagree 
change your answer above to a 1 or 0.
This book cannot help anyone
who values [hypotheticals]() more than the practical truth.

To make sure you are on time for life,
the single most important mental decision to make
is to identify the Food and Cake in your life.
Always gaurantee Food, bare necessities, is 
identified and first to be packed.
What time remains before you need to go (act),
may be spent thinking, trying out,
and admitting which pieces of Cake to bring.

Often, extreme experiences 
like being homeless or taking a cold shower,
help illuminate the difference between Food and Cake,
what really matters,
and what you can live without.

Whether you're up for extreme experiences or not,
you are engaging in only one side of
the profound human ability we call "cognition."
The agenda for writing this book is to facilitate
the other side of that profound ability: communication.

The more we can discuss our decisions for Food and Cake,
rationale and experiences, too,
the more we may benefit from others' time spent thinking,
and arrive at collective answers.
So, share and discuss your priorities with others.
This leverages the small ways
each of us live, "suffering" according to the next person,
as no two people's pris are identical.

Part two is 
a group of guidelines for
sharing ideas with the goal of 
identifying what matters.
The key arguments are radical application of
brevity,
value-assessing, and 
clarity.
These are accomplished with concrete guidance on actions.
Figure 1 highlights key IDEAS and 
their basic associations,
to reduce potential confusion with lay-definitions.

Thanks to
the first student of the boot camp, 
who bet to publish the first version.  
Thanks to those who didn't read it
to encourage me to revise.
May you find time to advocate your passions, too.

### Figure 1  
The relationship between core IDEAS of this book. 
These will appear throughout in capital letters. 
The first column refers to a Chapter,  
signifying broad themes (forces) 
under the words in the same row-box, fall.
Roughly, the second column contains
forces, concepts that require energy to deal with (food, work) or 
tend to work against your goals (doubt, habit),
and the last column suggest ideal goals (e.g., cake and relationship) and strategies (plan and align).

Circled concepts are Example Goals. 
All boxes are forces or attributes of them.
Roughly, words are arranged by association strength,
in terms of row, column, and boxes. The particular relationships are too complex to summarize, and the subject of respective chapters.



## The Garden

The Garden foregrounds the things we often lose sight of when conceptualizing: life is brief and we are mortal.
The Garden describe the key IDEAS of this book: the experience of being human--from eating and sleeping to thinking and meaning-making; the interdependence of mind and body (Garden-1), death and meaning (Garden-2), self and others (Garden-3).

"The Garden" is a description to be experienced. The purpose is for you to make
a Garden with the specifics of 
your own life, identity, and ambitions.


Your imagined garden
is a mental model of reality, 
strategic and powerful 
in bringing clarity. 
You need the Garden to combat the other strength of your mind,
its inherently idealistic nature, which sets you up 
for failure and suffering. 

### IDEAS and Plans  
The second part of each chapter,
"IDEAS and Plans" provides
literal and concrete language 
to the key IDEAs and consequences (LINKs)
in that chapter.

Definitions for IDEAS (ALL CAPS) are always 
describing some sense(s) of 
what you already know by the same name,
but LIMIT which relevant senses.
For example "WORK" is about careers,
but not 'yard work'.

Generally, this is to give
IDEAS measurable, consequential meaning.
See the chapters on WORDS 
for more.

You can read more about this in "PLANS"

A special case of plans is a LESSON.
The LESSONS are much like "The Garden",
meant to activate 
relevant parts of your reality or beliefs,
in a way that applies
the IDEAS introduced.
They are exercises that
take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete.
You can read more about them in "SR".
