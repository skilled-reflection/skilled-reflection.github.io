Change your thoughts. Change your life.
[reprise of title page]()

Comprehension is involuntary.
You cannot help but recognize meaning 
if you see or hear language.
This means that
your involuntary response
to this section title 
was likely similar to 
"Easier said than done."

Sometimes real meaning requires voluntary thought.
Often, all it takes is a
seemingly incompatible pair
of ideas.
For example,
this time when you
think about the title,
assume it is a reasonable,
serious, 
seriously valuable suggestion.
All it would take is for you
to honestly believe you can.
## Intro
 
This chapter can be reduced to the following problem and solution.
Words said (out loud or written),
and understood (heard or read) are
not usually what people mean.
They do not reflect what people want or need.

By engaging
the gap between words and reality,
you increase self-awareness (BET).

Better words mean
more practical understanding and expectations,
more complete desires, and the capacity
to make a concrete plan for achieving your goals.
This will naturally include
healthier communication and
more rewarding relationships.

A community with better words has
clearer idea sharing,
synthesizing, developing,
teaching and learning.

## Cognition

Speaking your mind is difficult.
A memory system dealing with language
is tasked to
translate thoughts into
the right words from thousands.
It is prone to inaccuracies.

Similarly, a listener 
focused on comprehending,
is not likely to monitor 
all the incidental priming effects
of words on a memory system.
Words said and words heard 
have a latent impact on
one's beliefs and behaviors.

These effects
are each discussed in terms of
how words can be used
for the better or worse.

## Words
### DEF
This book deals mainly with
actions and the felt-experience of the world.
Like any book,
this book uses words to describe the world
and its conditions.

This chapter is about
the act of describing, itself.

Saying WORDS is a very small
physical action, to describe
real actions and consequences.
Hearing and understanding a word
is also a small action,
that engages with WORDS--
a description
about the real world.

The issue is that descriptions
can be more and less right,
more and less helpful,
and we have little guidance on how to use them.

### as-hypothetical
Words are BETS on hypotheticals:
- truth and reality.
- lies and fantasy.

A PLAN is an arrangement
of WORD BETS.

Words efficiently simulate possible worlds.
You can think through
far more situations with words, than
you can (or should) try in reality.
Your GOALs can be described in words, and
words can be easily crossed out and revised.

Good WORDs maximize productivity of thought,
move you beyond pitfalls of CHUD,
direct attention to PRIS, and
predict reality;
improve decisions and make you smarter.

By thinking about 
all words you experience (LIB),
you can take control
to limit your WORD use
toward more productive ones,
improving READ and WRITE decisions,
increasing focus and time for GOALs.

Bad words keep CHUD expensive,
and waste time.

The COST of an individual word is tiny, but
we say tens of thousands per day (Levelt).
Reading, thinking, saying, and writing
a word perpetuates that word's IDEA over others,
either moving you toward a GOAL, or your HABIT.

### Plans
Do not use a word that is more of a Lie.
say the truth or be quiet.
Use words for decisions, not emotions.
Use to facilitate your life PLAN.
stop talking for other reasons.

Choose what you listen to:
assert boundaries against
exaggerated words or
unreliable ones.

Do not write PLANs you won't follow.
Read to revise plans into ones you'd follow.

### EXAMPLE

An EXAMPLE is
an individual, particular
event or object,
of reality.
An example with consequence is
a USE-CASE.
An example in-principle is
a HYPE (hypothetical/hype).

### IDEAS
### LINKS  

WORDs are one of two types:
 
1.  LINKS: words that give relationship between EXAMPLES, IDEAS, describe ACTIONS, ROLES, and transformations
2. IDEAS: words that refer to EXAMPLES.

An IDEA is a set of criteria
that LINK EXAMPLES
as similar (vs not).

The most basic IDEA
classifies EXAMPLES as
A or not-A.
"blue" is an IDEA that certain 
colored things are BLUE (A),
and all other colors are not BLUE.

Good IDEAS
group EXAMPLES
in a way that
directs attention toward
PLANS and GOALS.
Bad IDEAS distract.

The right LINK between IDEAs is
the foundation of every thought,
recipe or terrible calculation.


### RECIPE

A well-formed plan, especially lessons and instructions,
adhere to a RECIPE format.
The RECIPE format highlights the IDEAS and LINKS of your
point, and minimizes excessive STYLE.
 
1.  List key IDEAS.  
2.  Describe actions and transformations (LINKS).

## manifesto  
the following are principles of 
knowledge, language, and action.

#### speak   
Speak, write, initiate or respond only

in limited duration and words
dictated by intended outcome.
- Define everything empirically
  - comparison group/quantity (has unique outcome)
- Speak to bet.
- Idea > authorship (anonymity)

Do not at all
when actions or listening 
are needed.

#### listen  
listen / read
be with

when you need to learn / connect
- limited in duration/words needed
- to assess consent (agreement).

not when
- speaking values unadhered

Listening: 
- Distrust words and ego.
- Take nothing personally
- Remove / ignore style
- Read to refine beliefs and doubts.

# ROLES
## Scientist    

A scientist WORKs to win BETS against the UNKNOWN. 
They are a professional writer, 
evaluated on two metrics:

1.For their MEMES of CONTENT.
2.The net benefit of their MEMES on GOAL outcomes.

A scientist-researcher is a WRITER, 
a data-collector and hypothesis tester. 
A scientist-scholar is a READER,
curating toward theory development and COMM.

## Scholar    

a professional READER and 
Peer-Reviewer,
especially in curating the Scientist's insights.

evaluated by repost statistics 
(others as readers),  
akin to evaluating twitter users by their retweets.
