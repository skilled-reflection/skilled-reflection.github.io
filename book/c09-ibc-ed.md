### COMM-to Applicant  
  
How would your life look 
if you put it on paper?    
How do you get what you  
need and want?   
How do you clarify and 
direct your life?   

With better words.   
The right words will change 
your actions and your life.  
It's time to live a better life.   
It starts with your words,  
and a commitment to change.  
  
Committing is a personal decision, and risk.   

1.Is there a better version of you?  
2.Are you capable of moving toward it?  
3.Are you ready?  

### Attention: Be Here 
Now let me move your identity
from the ground to the sky.
Instead of a garden
your ambition is a star (point),
seen from the eyes of reality,
feet of progress underneath you.

Habit of strength needed
to take the right steps,
keen eyes to optimize course
focused mind to steady the foot.

Attention  
  Do not take notes,   
  simply pay attention.   
  Everything is meant plainly.   
  If you get confused, forget it, 
  recenter on (pay attention to) right now. 
  
Thinking  
  Our goal here is thinking.   
  Thinking happens in your heads.   
  In order to do something about it,   
  we need to think on paper.   
  [You'll write a lot. 
  You'll delete a lot.  
  You'll get good at writing.]  
  
Time  
  [You'll get good at thinking.
  but not because of attention]

  your attention is not reliable.   
  The clock is. 
  The clock is a cue to think.  
  When it goes off, 
  get back on task (pay attention).  
  
Truth  
  There is some truth inside   
  some of you more than others.   
  
  It is your job to  
  focus on the Truth in you.  
  (It is my job to tell you   
  how shitty of a liar you have been.   
)  
You will practice all this with 
Skilled Reflection. 

### READER

listening to another person.   

Read to assess your BET on 
the WORDs reflecting TRUTH for   
1-the author.   
2-you. Ask yourself how you saw the world before,  
and after reading.   
3-others. Ask if this generalizes to others.  
  
Assign WEIGHTs (0 to 9) to what you read.  
Whether to a book, sections, or a word.  
  
I BET this is true for:  
  
0 = not even the author.  
1 = only the author.   
2 = the author and me (Us), but less than 30% of PPL.  
3 = Us and 30% of PPL.  
9 = Us and approx. 90% of the human population.  

When reading,
Revise the pronouns as-written to align
with the corresponding bet above.
For example,
if you read the sentence,
"Everyone is best off running weekly until they die,"
and you bet the author might believe that
for himself, but
its not relevant for me or a lot of people,
then you may as well read the written sentence as
"I am best off running weekly until I die."
This is what you've chosen to believe,
given the text.
Admitting it allows you to grant that observation,
and the argument for doing this is
that it makes it easier for you to
give credit and opportunity to make an argument
where it is due,
and not simply ignore it
because the author didn't read your mind.

I share this because it seems to me
not only is the last point very common
amongst active readers,
almost increasingly so.



## IBC 
On the computer screen is a memo:
This is a boot camp 
whose purpose is to train adults 
to think harder, clearer and more effectively;   
to produce intelligent solutions 
for personal and social puzzles;   
to have a higher cognitive discipline;   
to instill shared values about   
reason, thinking and discourse; and   
to empower.  
  
a training program designed to   
break down bad habits of thought,
amidst a culture of rational thinking
isolated from the outside world.  
  
Here you will relentlessly confront
your ideas 
about the world, 
with instructors   
 drilling intellectual skills 
(writing essays, arguing for ideas, and
developing proposals for action).   

You would be trained to 
move toward your goals with focus,
even in the face of perceptual, physical, or emotional distractions.   
Over time, students could expect to cultivate   
a sharper focus on cognitive objectives,   
resilience to distractions and challenges.
If you graduate,
it will be with the ability   
to identify, develop, and communicate ideal critical,  
rational arguments,   
positions or plans (orally or written) given the available knowledge, finite time, and resources at hand   
(reference material, teamwork).   

Students would also learn 
a code of behavior for
being a community leader;
collaborating or competing with
an idiosyncratic, irrational world.  
  
The central requirement for applicants would be 
a commitment to better understand 
the self and world.
