# Section One: Education    

## pay attention  

How would your life look 
if you put it on paper?

With better words. 
The right words will change 
your actions and your life.
It's time to live a better life. 
It starts with your words,
and a commitment to change.

1.Is there a better version of you?
2.Are you capable of moving toward it?
3.Are you ready?

If your answers are yes, then you are a student.
Your first task is to listen:

*move*
Habit of strength needed
to take the right steps,
keen eyes to optimize course
focused mind to steady the foot.
*emove*

Think, student.
Do not take notes, 
simply pay attention. 
Everything I say is meant plainly. 
 If you get confused, forget it,
and pay attention to right now.

Our goal here is thinking. 
Thinking happens in your heads. 

*push-writer*
In order to do something about it, 
we need to think on paper. 
 [You'll write a lot.
You'll delete a lot.
You'll get good at writing.]
*epush*

*push-focus*
[You'll get good at thinking.
  but not because of attention]

your attention is not reliable. 
 The clock is.
The clock is a cue to think.
 When it goes off,
get back on task (pay attention).
*epush*

Right now your job is to think
about the truth you see in what i say. 

### READER   
Reading is the same as 
listening to me,
except the pace of my words
don't determine 
how fast you have to think,
or remind you to
PAY ATTENTION!

Your attention cannot be trusted,
student,
to be left alone while reading.
So the clock will babysit you.

*pull-clock-above*
*pull-reader-ex-below*

Read to assess your BET on 
the WORDs reflecting TRUTH for 
1-the author. 
2-you. Ask yourself how you saw the world before,
and after reading. 
3-others. Ask if this generalizes to others.

Assign WEIGHTs (0 to 9) to what you read.
Whether to a book, sections, or a word.

I BET this is true for:

0 = not even the author.
1 = only the author. 
2 = the author and me (Us), but less than 30% of PPL.
3 = Us and 30% of PPL.
9 = Us and approx. 90% of the human population.

Perhaps you've had the experience of reading
and thinking, "this doesn't apply to reality."
When reading, your goal is to isolate the truth from the lie.

Often, this is as simple as changing
the pronouns in the writing.
For example,
if you read the sentence,
"Everyone is best off running weekly until they die,"
and you bet the author might believe that
for himself, but that
it's not relevant for me or a lot of people.
Changing the pronouns of the sentence
will get us pretty close to the truth (you believe):
"I am best off running weekly until I die."
Now the author's words are consistent with your truth.
This allows you to grant that observation,
and the argument for doing this is
that it makes it easier for you to
make an argument where it is due,
and not simply ignore it
because the author didn't read your mind.

## The Intellectual Bootcamp (IBC)   
On the computer screen is a memo:  

This is a boot camp 
whose purpose is to train adults 
to think harder, clearer and more effectively; 
to produce intelligent solutions 
for personal and social puzzles; 
to have a higher cognitive discipline; 
to instill shared values about 
reason, thinking and discourse; and 
to empower.

a training program designed to 
break down bad habits of thought,
amidst a culture of rational thinking
isolated from the outside world.

Here you will relentlessly confront
your ideas 
about the world, 
with instructors 
drilling intellectual skills
(writing essays, arguing for ideas, and
developing proposals for action). 

You would be trained to 
move toward your goals with focus,
even in the face of perceptual, physical, or emotional distractions. 
Over time, students could expect to cultivate 
a sharper focus on cognitive objectives, 
resilience to distractions and challenges.
If you graduate,
it will be with the ability 
to identify, develop, and communicate ideal critical,
rational arguments, 
positions or plans (orally or written) given the available knowledge, finite time, and resources at hand 
(reference material, teamwork).   

Students would also learn 
a code of behavior for
being a community leader;
collaborating or competing with
an idiosyncratic, irrational world.

The central requirement for applicants would be 
a commitment to better understand 
the self and world. 

# Section Two: Culture    

## Intro  


## Roles    
*push-up before 'you are a student'*

A role is a set of attitudes and actions.
A student has two roles to think in: Reader and Writer.
A reader is a listener and observer.

### READER  

### WRITE    

BET on WORDs.
A writer invests time and energy 
to map feelings onto words. 

Good writing is discovering, 
curating, and applying insight. 
Bad WRITING has an author; *ad hominem* 

Revisions also make you a WRITER.
When you revise words (yours or others') 
to maximize your BET,
you are a writer.


Separate thought and self (author), 
by BETTING explicitly. 

State your assumptions, 
do not justify them. 
-is-STYLE-bad

Replace \"I am.\" with tag words.

Strive for COMM-CONTENT and brevity;
Write only valuable BETs, or
WORDs that manifest valuable BETs.
Prioritize understanding over original writing.

WRITING for LIB-PPL, 
relatable, depersonalized, objective words,
minimizes ROT, maximizes PLAN utility.

*push-revision*
PEERs: 
Forget *who* provides REVISION and how much. 
Get answers from others.

### Student  
*push-beginning*
Students are PPL with
IDEAS from EXPERIENCE toward 
selfish GOALS. 

Lessons depend on 
students' prior knowledge. 

A STUDENT 

1.has a goal that can be better named and planned.
2.requires time away from BETTING.
3.admits not knowing but capable.

Students learn
to represent their knowledge in words;
to prefer better, alternative words.
A student
sees the impersonal as more reliable 
both for selfish GOALS and
social ones. 

A bad student studies 
to avoid action, or 
for its own sake.

A Student WRITES IDEAs and GOALs
to their INSTRUCTOR.
*epush*

### Instructor    
A guardian of 
1.True IDEAs expressed in COMM, and
2.WRITER of a general PLAN (this book).

An instructor READS, and enforces 
BETs on LINKs toward a PLAN. 

1.Minimize student effort and time to write. 
2.READ for 
 - cognitive biases,
- illogical appeals, and
- imprecise language, and
 WRITE feedback that is
  - dispassionate and neutral, yet
- invested and True.
3.Reward defense of arguments based on 
(Truth:) REALITY, SELF, and VALUES. 
4.Reward IDEAS shared (vs personal).

### RLTP--Peers  
*push-revision*
Peer review is a powerful learning tool.

The peer WRITER 
works with uncompromised objectivity, 
and liberty to employ Truth, 
however subjectively "harsh".

### Scientist    

A scientist WORKs to win BETS against the UNKNOWN. 
They are a professional writer, 
evaluated on two metrics:

1.For their MEMES of CONTENT.
2.The net benefit of their MEMES on GOAL outcomes.

A scientist-researcher is a WRITER, 
a data-collector and hypothesis tester. 
A scientist-scholar is a READER,
curating toward theory development and COMM.

### Scholar    

a professional READER and 
Peer-Reviewer,
especially in curating the Scientist's insights.

evaluated by repost statistics 
(others as readers),  
akin to evaluating twitter users by their retweets.
*epush*


### Agreement  
This is
an in-person immersive experience.

You only really learn
what you need to know
to be who you really want.
You won't learn
unless you cannot escape needing it;
in a dedicated environment 
that fosters acquisition,
minimizes interference.

Whether you're here for 
the 7- or 30-day experience,
you will work hard every minute.

*focus*
There will be no phone or internet access.

For every minute of lesson on my time,
students are to
provide two minutes of writing,
either toward others' learning or 
in direct application toward their goal.

Dedicate to identity growth. 
Be:

1.Quiet, except when tasks require verbal response.
2.Receptive to work and feedback provided by the instructor.
3.Committed to producing genuinely inspired ideas, working quickly,
and seeking improvement.
4.Respectful that all are equal in voice, and aim to describe
solutions with collective values.
5.Receptive and responsive to prompts and observations (from peers and/or
 instructors)
  especially CHUD, vague language, and cognitive bias.
6.Motivated to describe solutions that benefit others, when possible, including peer-review

Now,
what is it you'll learn?
Precisely and only what is needed
to trust a clear picture of
what your life is. 
You will first learn
how to make a plan, a map of who you are,
and who you want to be.
You will exercise Part one of this book,
until you plan is good enough to be wrong,
and truthful enough to hurt.

This will be the beginning of change,
and the first test of your commitment.
Your performance is evaluated simply:
whether or not you end up 
eating, 
sleeping, 
thinking, 
talking, and 
acting differently.


*push-words*
## manifesto  

If you an informed STUDENT,
then you will arrive at the following
principles of knowledge, language, and action.

### better language / world  

Distrust words and ego.
- Take nothing personally
- Define everything empirically
  - comparison group/quantity (has unique outcome)
- Remove / ignore style
- Speak for reasons only
- Idea > authorship (anonymity)
- Read to refine beliefs and doubts.
- Write to bet.

#### speak   
Speak, write, initiate or respond only

in limited duration and words
dictated by intended outcome.

Do not at all
when actions or listening 
are needed.

#### listen  
listen / read
be with

when you need to learn / connect
- limited in duration/words needed
- to assess consent (agreement).

not when
- speaking values unadhered

#### repair  
when listening to invalid speech,
after--repair
1m-gently with gestures  
2m-briefly and clearly with words  
3m-firmly with boundaries  
5m-civilly end conversation and walk away.  


#### dialog / revise / anon  
write what you bet  
revise toward truth  
- to max others' bets

radical anti-ownership of ideas  
- edit for anyone with the authority of your autobiography  
- for the benefit of the OP  
- expecting only feedback  

### actions  
commit values to bets  
- self + calling > cakes  
- idea > xref  
- bet > fact > belief > word  
- action > money > words > thoughts  

solutions to problems  
- remove problem src or self from problem.  
- accept that problem comes from other solutions  
- revise those solutions (ie reuse)  
- blitz solution  
- eat, sleep better  
- wake up: cold shower, pint of water, work out, deaf/blind hour, spend time with an ugly person  

minimalism; align, revise and keep fit  
- keep only hf things in smallest box possible  
- keep clean  
- keep routine (self) needs minimal  
  - stuff, expectations, plans (movement)  

### actions  
"if" requires an action argument.  
- (tethering hypotheticals)
