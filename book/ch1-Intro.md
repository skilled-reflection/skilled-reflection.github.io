
## Introduction
The incremental science
we are familiar with
identifies a gap in knowledge, 
and proposes to fill it.

This book 
begins with YOUR understanding;
of yourself and your actions, first,
then of your immediate environment,
and then with extreme caution,
your beliefs about everything else,
including others' understanding, etc.

If we were to take everyone's above assessment,
some facts would emerge as universal:
things about eating and sleeping and dying,
for instance.
Most observations will vary,
but they will always connect to fundamental experiences.
In this way it is possible to collect and summarize
an empirical description of reality,
and all its possibilities from birth to death.
This is the ground truth for the social sciences.

The core assumption is that
any improved empirical description in this way
will be useful for
both individual and collective issues
of the social sciences.

What an easy solution!
Unfortunately,
we don't already have it,
because of a number of methodological challenges.
To illustrate these issues, 
consider just a single, knowable event
that a single person experiences.
what that person
- understands about themselves,
- and their experience,
- and makes of it,
- and reports,
will vary widely.

The primary purpose of this book
is to begin solving these problems,
by presenting YOU
with an approach to standardizing
your OWN experiences.
That is,
this book is a standard
for understanding and solving 
the problems in your life,
framed purely by your own terms.

Before I elaborate on that objective,
I'll briefly name all the problems identified by
people who spend a lifetime
as a student ("academics"),
have identified.

### Problems
The set of problems here,
I like to think of akin to GERMS.
Both before and after their discovery,
they were everywhere.
We are used to them.

There is no universal or ground truth for:  

#### Experience, Value   
What is the material (money) value of
- happiness?
- food?
- staying dry?

How much does it depend on
- how much sleep you've gotten the last week?
- your marital status?

#### rational action  
Economists flipped shit at irrational behavior.
Given options A or B, what to do?

At the limits, I'll argue this sort of question is
the building block of what we aim for with
- education, intelligence, skills.

Whereas economists and behavioral research
have put humans in research labs 
to see which they choose,
I argue the answer is 
to remind humans of making better choices 
out in their lives,
ask them to keep track of the ones they did,
why, and what happened.

I call this the "bet" framework. Its standardization lends for quantifying and summarizing many decisions.

Couple the above data with experiences and values, and we can interpret results for future problem-solvers, or, "educate our youth".
See "to Education" in Chapter 1.

#### Words  
These give us great traction on 
one of the foundational problems in philosophy: 
the meaning of words.

The vast complexity and nuance of words,
its core intractability
comes from the assumption that
words are honest and clear.
They aren't, but by standardizing
communication, they could be.

This means removing politeness and authorship
from meaning making, using, and sharing.
Especially for the nature of science.

### Answers  
One of the most common pitfalls
to perspectives and solutions 
is to propose that
people change their behavior.

"If only so-and-so
would quit smoking,"
or "give a shit about global warming."

Ironically, it could be said
this book is the complete and universal
form of that fallacy,
albeit with a critical caveat:
I demand only all the change
that can and will happen,
of your own will.

I posit that the foundational,
universal change of behavior needed,
are the ones that YOU genuinely
assert you are ready to make.

This is the point of the book.
I will give you all the tools
to verify, let alone test and implement,
changes you claim you're ready for.

This is Skilled Reflection.

Each of the problems and solutions
presented above are
characterized honestly,
in terms of the selfish gain
YOU stand to make;
always, only at
a cost of change.

Still it is probably not enough
to overcome all habits.
So I also promote 
a culture and ethos of rational change.
It must be made artificially,
but, with immersion,
I bet this is sufficient
for it to be adopted fluently.

This is the IBC.

So, READER,
you are now equipped with the topics.

First, you will encounter
my worldview as a proposal
for an education program,
designed specifically for YOU.

Once you've walked through
its core mission, expectations, lessons,
Part two will take you
through the foundational concepts,
and key lines of reasoning
to fully implement the program
in your life.

After that, you're done.
Go bet on and 
live your better life.

For any of the academic types,
see me afterward.
