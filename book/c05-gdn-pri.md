## The Garden: Pri  
### LIFE, LOVE and DEATH  

Many people believe in seeds with special powers, 
like true love, or winning the lottery. 
One seed grows the duration of your life, 
which you rarely notice but are often aware of. 
When you eat it, 
the sun sets for  
the last time and you bite the dust. 
Think about this, but don't dwell on it. 
It happens to all of us.  
  
Think of what you can grow from the seeds of the best apple in  
your crop, which you tended to with dedication and skill. 

*REALITY*
Think of what's happening  
right this very moment: 
nothing in your garden, 
while you're sitting  
here thinking. 
Reflect only enough to improve your actions.  
  
Your garden allows you 
to ground the many goals of your life 
into a medium the mind is well-equipped to analyze: 
visual space. 

Maybe it  
seems unnecessary to represent work satisfaction and relationship  
quality in terms of carrots and tomatoes. 

When you arrive at the moment  
of boredom or frustration in attempting to put your life in terms of  
concrete IDEAS and actions between them (LINKS), 
ask yourself why you  
are bored and frustrated attempting to define 
the things that apparently  
define you. 
What is happening in your life, 
and what is in your control  
if these are unclear? 
If you are not reflecting on your life, 
your garden is a foggy labyrinth and 
you are a drunk gardener wearing  
oven-mitts.  

### Bad days
Maybe you are sick,
down or depressed.

Do not look out onto your field 
as a day to work.
You have assumed your field is only meaningful 
for its future.
Today your field gives to you, and 
you should take what you need.
This is what it is for.
Do not beat yourself up 
for what you cannot give today.

Instead, prevent the urge to be disappointed
the next time you are less than productive,
by planning a fact of being human:
you are always sometimes less than productive,
and always occasionally 
in very inopportune times and ways.


## 04 Pri 177  
  
All GOALs rely on a single, finite  
source of attention, and existence:  
you.  

Managing the set of goals in your life is   
the goal of PRI.   

At its best, this limiting fact
drastically improves the reality
of PLANs and GOALS.
At its worst, it is the most common
oversight responsible for bloated CHUD.

GOAL importance (PRIs) partly depends on context.
  
### SAVINGS    
completing an action  
that serves various goals.   
  
An example is Grouping.
(See Fig. 3)
Grouping works for  
IDEAS, PLANS, GOALS, or HOME things.

Figure 3.   
SAVINGs are illustrated as a function of GROUPs,
across three rooms. The same OBJECTs are: 
As you find them (Room 1),   
labeled clearly (Room 2), and  
Grouped by function (Room 3).    
Letters reflect different things, and  
shape differences reflect different kinds of things.  


### RETIREMENT-group
time until you die;
resource and automation for 
remaining SELF (CHUD maintenance).   
  
### TIME  

The constant (or denominator) for 
FORCES, FORGETTING,
PRI, and LIB.


  
## L4: Time  
These are two exercises that
can be used to plan your day.
They are set up in a way
that confronts one of the most common
mistakes of planning:
being unrealistic in your expectations.

### A. Typical Day  
Think about a day and how much time you  
spend on various activities, averaged over 365 days in a year. 
Then pick a GOAL,  
and estimate the changes  
required to make it happen. 
The first step reflects your HABITS, 
and the changes reflect COSTS.  
  
__Table 3. __First approximation of how my time is  
spent (hours), sorted by GOALS and subgoals, and any details that are  
worth noting. Hours total 24, and assume 365 days / year. Non-daily  
activities such as visiting the dentist are factored in, accordingly.  
Second approximation (ideal) reflects where I would like to be over the  
next 3-4 months of my life.  
  
### B. Morning Bets  
  
Task 1. 5m, 50w.  
  
Take five minutes to produce the words that are most likely to  
accomplish your goals for the day. This may include describing the  
goals, the plan, and/or the doubts.  
  
Task 2. 5m, 50w.  
  
Copy those 50 words, and revise them according to the following  
instruction.  
  
Replace "accomplish your goals" with "do". In 50 words, what should you  
(or an all-knowing observer) bet on that you will do, today? Regardless  
of what you assumed in Response one, do not write with the intention of  
'motivating' yourself, but to simply describe your day. (If this is too  
hard, simply evaluate what you did yesterday.)  
  
Task 3. 5m, 0w.  
  
Compare your responses. Positive differences (more optimistic) in your  
first response reflect bets you are making against your habits.
