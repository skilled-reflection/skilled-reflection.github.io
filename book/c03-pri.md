## Chapter 3.	Priorities

1.	Think of what you can grow from the seeds of the best apple in your crop, 
which you tended to with dedication and skill or luck.
2.	Before there was a garden, you lived as if you wouldn't die. 
3.	Even today, you hold some GOALS on the assumption that you will start 
working toward them, tomorrow.
4.	I did, at least. The list of my GOALS grew like a wild vine and I found myself 
overwhelmed by what else I wanted, and yet an inability to equalize various 
goals. 
5.	For example, sleep is vital FOOD, but perhaps only 4 hours of it. 
6.	If you like to sleep in on the weekends, that is CAKE.
7.	In your garden, you are limited in what you can do in one day.
8.	Even if you build machines to work fields that stretch out to the horizons, 
9.	you can only eat so much in a day and a lifetime.
10.	How do you most want to spend your time?
11.	If your GOAL is to obtain something you do not yet have and have never 
tasted, be careful. It may not satisfy you how you imagine.
12.	Suppose your goal takes 300 hours of labor.
13.	You might spend 10 years accruing the time on task, or immerse yourself 
and achieve your GOAL in under 1 year.
14.	To avoid let downs, better to achieve your GOAL as soon as possible.
15.	Today, you grow the best apple you can,
16.	yet having tasted it, you might discover a more refined GOAL is closer to 
your heart.
17.	Whether this apple is FOOD or CAKE, the more you align with yourself, the 
more you will see your GOALS differently than you first conceived of them.
18.	Leave time in your life to achieve the next GOAL.

### Death and Sickness

19.	Many PPL believe in seeds with special powers, like true love, or winning the 
lottery. 
20.	One seed grows the duration of your life, which you rarely notice but are often 
aware of. 
21.	When you eat it, the sun sets for the last TIME and you bite the dust. It happens 
to all of us.
22.	Think about this, but don't dwell on it. 

### Bad days

23.	Maybe you are sick, down or depressed.
24.	Then today, do not look out onto your field as a day to WORK. 
25.	Today your field gives to you, and you should take what you need. This is what it 
is for. 
26.	Do not beat yourself up for what you cannot give today. This assumes your field 
is only meaningful for its future. 
27.	And before you're well again, remember this moment well, so you may 
28.	prevent the urge to be disappointed the next TIME you are less than productive. 
29.	If you must WORK to feel worthwhile, WORK to budget for a fact of being 
human: 
30.	you are always sometimes less than productive, and occasionally your setbacks 
come in unfortunate forms, at inconvenient times.
Attention and time
31.	Think of what's happening right this very moment: nothing in your garden, while 
you're sitting here thinking. 
32.	Reflect only enough to improve your actions.

33.	The GOAL of PRI is to manage the set of GOALS in your life.
34.	All GOALS rely on a single, limited source of attention, and existence: you.
35.	Attention:
35.1.	At its best, this limiting fact drastically improves the reality of PLANS and 
GOALS. 
35.2.	At its worst, it is the most common oversight responsible for bloated 
CHUD. 
35.3.	GOAL importance (PRIS) partly depends on context.
35.4.	Group GOALS by shared actions, places, or times. Make/group/keep, 
order, reduce in the order presented in Figure 4. "A place for everything, 
everything in its place"
35.5.	ALIGN SELF and CAKE 
35.6.	Adopt all your GOALS to REALITY ("above", e-you will die). 
35.7.	Think about the sum of your GOALS,
36.	Ask what it would take to change (if possible), and whether change is worth it.
37.	Savings occur anytime you complete an action that serves various GOALS.
37.1.	An example is Grouping. (See Fig. 3) 
37.2.	Apply to IDEAS, PLANS, GOALS, or HOME things.
38.	TIME is the constant (or denominator) for FORCES, FORGETTING, PRI, and LIB. 
38.1.	Do not ignore TIME. 
38.2.	Estimate durations accurately for GOAL accomplishment.
38.3.	Study TIME to learn reality, SELF, and their LINK.
38.4.	Continually assess whether GOAL benefits outweighs costs of TIME.

39.	Maybe it seems unnecessary to represent WORK satisfaction and relationship 
quality in terms of carrots and tomatoes.
40.	When you get bored, ask yourself why attempting to understand and define 
yourself bores you. 
41.	What is happening in your life, and what is in your control if these are unclear? 
42.	If you are not reflecting on your life, your garden is a foggy labyrinth, and you 
are a drunk gardener wearing oven-mitts.

### Your Calling, Part I

43.	Your calling,  
your highest CAKE,  
is yours to name.  
  
44.	If you overcome your DOUBTs,  
and see reality plainly,  
you will want peace.  
  
45.	But we all have DOUBTs, so  
you want some form of  
dignity and affirmation.  
  
46.	Tell me your calling, student,  
and subtracting from peace,  
I'll tell you your DOUBTs.  
  
47.	On mastering my book  
your life will be regimented  
to afford your calling.
