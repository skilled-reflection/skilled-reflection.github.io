## to Students  

your calling,  
your highest value,  
is yours to name;  
an idea about the world,  
bounded by reality and your doubts.  
  
if you overcome your doubts,  
and see reality plainly,  
you will want peace.  
    
but we all have doubts, so  
you want some form of  
dignity and affirmation.  
    
tell me your calling, student,  
and subtracting from peace,  
i'll tell you your doubts.  
  
On mastering my book  
your life will be regimented  
to afford your calling.  
  
tell me the missing chapter  
that lets you achieve peace  
instead of a life of regimen,  
so that I may find mine.

Welcome,
You vibrating sack of meat   
taking up my space and time.  

a teacher and student
take on a debt of time to
bet on my life;
a radical co-dependency. 
why would you do this?  
  
effective teaching
assumes a shared rationality.

you are crazy
for wanting to be a teacher.
you have only one thing to teach:
me to believe you.
  
you will do everything to 
put the truth in front of me.  
if i find out you withhold truth, 
i will punish you with it.  

you are a teacher when you 
re-do your shitty lecture, 
until your student has earned 
both your time.

## questions  
it's been asked,
"What is the diff
between loving,
and being in love?"
what evidence would
support an answer beyond
the feeling
associated with
the idea of a difference?

What's the diff
between loving and
being in love with yourself?
or with god?

it appears that
over 10k years ago,
humans moved a certain way
that suggests both
an intelligent era
yet a time before the Answers.

Recently we discovered a magnet
inscribed with patterns
we eventually discovered
you called language.
we are still in the process
of understanding how it
relates to Answers,
as it is 
far too inconsistent
to be a proto-form of Answers.

it is unclear yet
how much Language
it will take to get you here.
We hope as little as possible.

what you call questions,
and recognize as suffering,
deserve immediate attention.

As we continue to work on this
communication bridge,
let me end this first message
in 10000 years to say:

You have given hope
through the patterns
represented in skilled reflection,
structured enough
to give systematicity
in complex representation
that dimly illuminates
the world it attempts to project.

Sincerely,  
the Answerword
