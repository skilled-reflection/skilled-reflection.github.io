### Lesson: DOUBT 

57.	Imagine receiving the perfect email that meets your needs; addresses 
your fears, frustrations, paralysis. One that gives you the guidance 
only you could dream of.
58.	Task 1. 4m, 40w. List things the email should include feelings, tangible 
things, states, WORDS of wisdom, anything you need to hear.
59.	Task 2. 4m, author name, revise. Consider who could write this: a 
boss, a best friend, a stranger. Add an author and revise as needed.
60.	Task 3. 15m, 200w. Now write that email. Don't worry about how or 
why "they would say this." Focus on making sure the letter covers the 
things you NEED to hear.
61.	Task 4. 2m, "your name". Plot twist. Russia sends long range missiles 
that take out U.S. infrastructure including the internet. The 
government issues a full lockdown, and you're home alone without 
Netflix.
62.	Two days in, an email appears on your computer.
63.	It's the letter! How is this possible? Slowly you realize, you must have 
written this letter. You did!
64.	Add these WORDS at the bottom of your letter:
65.	"Respectfully, (your name)"
66.	Read what you need to hear, in the true leader's voice: yours.
67.	Task 5. 15m, 0w. Your original author may have had the authority, 
resources, or information you don't. For example, "Here's 20 thousand 
dollars to build your classroom."
68.	Revise to make the letter practical.
69.	Tip 1: For resources you don't have-- money, TIME, influence-- accept 
that indeed, you do not have power over these things, give up 
attempts to control, and welcome your feelings.
70.	Tip 2: For guiding your behavior--decisions, actions, confidence-- give 
permission to take action.
