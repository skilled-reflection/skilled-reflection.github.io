## The Garden: PPL

Think of the seeds of people
that clarify and cultivate your garden.

In someone else's garden, you have (only) what you see immediately
before you, and their word about what came before.
Maybe they are your friend, and he needs help with some unruly vines, or
maybe you are captivated by some apples you haven't seen before.
Everything that happens in their garden could be thought of as a seed in
your garden: how much time your visit takes and what you're left with,
after.
 
Sometimes, people are like water, bringing extra life to needy crops.
Sometimes people are careless and track weeds in on their boots, or
over-encourage your interests until you sprain an ankle, or
come to your garden and  distract you,
make you anxious or bored or excited.
How are people affecting your garden?
 
*NORMS*
Where do you get seeds from
and how did you know to plant them?
From
other people, right?
No silly, you don't know how to plant all these
plants!
Lucky for you, many of the most important crops, products, and
savings are already grown, prepared and handed to you---in exchange for
money, which you have from spending time on a much larger, collective
garden called society, doing some very specialized thing called WORK.
You'll do about 80,000 hours of work in your life in exchange for
already grown apples and baked cake, and things like toilets to take
your poop somewhere else.
 
The expectation that you will WORK for money for goods
is normal (NORMS).
NORMS may or may not always
be the most reliable way for you.

## Ideas

### FORCE

cause of change.
There are forces within your control, and
forces outside your control.

MAINTENANCE is what it costs
to neither move toward nor away from a GOAL.
RISKS are covered by INSURANCE.

### Norms
NORMS are the web of FORCES of
all actions of all people, including
WORK, religion, popular attitudes, and DOUBTS.
 
NORMS benchmark the COST of living.
NORMs pay out MONEY for WORK,
and can also negatively impact your GOALs.

When you are individual,
NORMS push against you
 
(PPL'S LANGUAGE is made from NORMS.)

### Work
WORK is made to serve NORMs, not you.
yet takes 80k hours of your time.

WORK pays the broadest INSURANCE: MONEY.
Money is traded for MAINTENANCE of
SELF and VALUES.

### RLTP
GOALs about PPL.
Good ones are aligned
with your VALUES,
Bad ones cost you.
RLTPs are reciprocal BETS,
yours of them, and vice versa.

RLTPs, especially family members,
coordinate many GOALS for SAVINGS.

### ALIGN

Adjust direction of your goal
to be more similar to another force,
usually one acting against your goal.

## Plans
### FORCES
name CHUD; better to know them
Study how forces work against you.
ALIGN GOALS with FORCES

### PPL
Pick WORK and RLTPs that maximize your other PRIs including possibly one that maximizes time and money to apply to other PRIs.

i-Pick friends the same way.
Consider your actions and choices about people carefully.
Maximally ALIGN with NORMS with least compromise to PRIs.
align (get along with) people.
