### Abstract 

This book asks and answers a series of questions about the nature of a 
productive life and its implications, as follows. 
1.	Self. What must I do (FOOD) in order to have what I want (CAKE)? Food is 
health, comprising maximum physical energy (fit) and mental energy (wit). CAKE 
is motivation, meaning and will to live (PRI). 
2.	Pri. What actions maximize cake in my life? Efficient fit and wit maximally used, 
before death (plan). 
3.	Ppl. What are people? Parallel universes dealing with the identical problem set. 
4.	Bet. What actions result in CAKE? Steps taken now according to my plan (bets) 
and revision according to bet wins and failures (CHUD). 
5.	School. What now? Learn all your answers (student), along with other ppl 
(peers): go to school (ibc). 
6.	Words. What do i study? How to minimize the difference between your pri 
(words) and data (reality), or how to increase bet wins, and minimize their 
failures over your time as a student (data). 
7.	Revisions. When am i done? When your plan for bets is according to pris, 
prepared for CHUD is good enough to bet on (revision): as soon as possible 
(blitz).

productivity, because it is written by one instructor obsessed with discipline and 
science fiction.?
