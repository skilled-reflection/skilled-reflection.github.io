## T1: Bet
  
You can take control of your life, or 
you can let the world bet for you.
  
You can't help but think
how to make your life better. 
You can leave it to chance or 
commit yourself to finding out
which thoughts are right,
and live that better life.

A commitment is the first step,
but far from the last.

If you want your dreams to become real,
listen to your doubts.
  
Then test them.
The outcome will either 
move you toward your goal, 
or to adjust your expectations.
  
Winning means your reality is 
one step toward your goal. 
Losing is the wake-up call 
to be more realistic.

Betting is a protocol 
to guide you to reality, 
and, if you're lucky, 
your dreams might fit in.
  
How real will your dreams get before you die?
  
### L1: Imagine  
A stranger comes to your garden
at the end of a long day,
chopping his jaw.
You look up.

"No really, consider it, right now. 
Imagine the most realistic, attainable, 
best life you could have. 
Imagine taking the first step 
and then stay with the thought. 
Listen to the fear that surfaces. 
For the moment, never mind 
how the world has gotten in your
way. 
How are you in your own way?"

He seems to be in your way.
He's staring past
your wet forehead.

"See your doubts with curiosity. 
Now bet on what you tell yourself you believe. Bet on overcoming them."

You would like to say something like,
'I don't need to bet
to better myself
or know my doubts.'

But you mostly only think of
frustration and say,
"I appreciate the suggestion."

"Let's both bet. 
Name what you believe 
you can accomplish tomorrow,
in terms of 
what you think holds you back most.
If you make it happen
before sun-up,
you'll be over 
the most daunting hurdle
between you and your outcome.
And I'll give you
the equivalent of your harvest, today.
If you fail, 
you leave me today's harvest."

"Okay," you say.
And then this is exactly what you decide
to tell him will help you, 
and show him who you are.

"The rocks on the far field.
They're on a slippery slope.
To build the home I want,
I need those rocks, but 
I'm afraid of falling.
I've collected every
rock on my land and
I need those rocks. 
Tomorrow I'll finish
my foundation
with rocks from the slippery slope."


## Ideas
## BET
Betting is confronting  
costs, habits, unknowns and doubts
that stand in the way
of your wants and dreams.
The time that passes and
the status of your goal
when it runs out are
an intersection of reality:
the world and you.

To name them,
is to shed CHUD.


Every IDEA you hold is a BET
with a rolling deadline, 
idiosyncratic successes and revisions.

A BET is a PLAN template for 
reconciling REALITY with CHUD,
to accomplish GOALs. 

Successes shorten your PLAN, and 
the distance to your GOAL.
Failures imply CHUD. 

Figure 2. Bet schema. 
CHUD is the consequence of a PLAN
that simplifies the GOAL;
both are updated when the deadline passes. 

## C.H.U.D.
  
CHUD encompasses the changes
in you, the world, 
and your goal
for you to achieve it.

### COSTS
COST is the change needed 
- time (labor and resources)
from your current state 
to accomplish a GOAL
  
### HABITS
Your dominant tendencies (FORCES). 
Bad HABITS are FORCES working against your GOALS.
Good HABITS are ALIGNED with GOALS.
  
### UNKNOWNS  
As long as you have not arrived at the goal, 
there are Unknowns.
It is unclear if you can control it,
but you can estimate it.
Failures reveal DOUBTS.

The difference (error) between 
your Plan's estimate of reality,
and Reality.
  
### DOUBTS  
Good DOUBTS temper
an optimistic PLAN.
Bad DOUBTS fuel bad habits and fantasies.
  
Fear, anxiety, and jealousy,
reflect overestimation of UNKNOWNs.
Resistance to change due to arrogance and ego 
reflect underestimation of UNKNOWNs.
  
To be **distracted** from
or bored of
your plan is
- anxiety about your future.
- discomfort toward present reality.
- distrust in your past. 


## Plans
### BETS
(BET) Name:
    -   a step in your PLAN,
    -   a **deadline** to achieve it, and
    -   the C.H.U.D. for that duration.

Attempt to succeed, and document your efforts.

When the deadline arrives, take stock.
    -   Revise your PLAN and CHUD based on your effort. 
    -   Start another BET or GOAL.

### UNK
Explore and learn where the line of control is,
Expand control productively, and
Let go of unhelpful attempts to control.

## L9: Doubt (Pandemic) 
  
Imagine receiving the perfect email 
that meets your needs; 
addresses your fears, frustrations, paralysis. 
One that gives you the guidance 
only you could dream of.
  
**Task 1. 4m, 40w**
  
List things the email should include: 
feelings, tangible things, 
states, words of wisdom,
anything you need to hear.
  
**Task 2. 4m, author name, revise**
  
Consider who could write this: a boss, a best friend, a stranger. 
Add an author, and revise as needed.
  
**Task 3. 15m, 200w**
  
Now write that email. 
Don't worry about how or why
"they would say this."
Focus on making sure the letter
covers the things you NEED to hear.
  
**Task 4. 2m, "your name"**
  
Plot twist. 
Russia sends long range missiles that take out
U.S. infrastructure including the internet. 
The government issues a full lockdown, and
you're home alone without netflix. 
  
Two days in, an email
appears on your computer.
  
It's the letter! How is this possible?
Slowly you realize, 
you must have written this letter. 
You did!
  
Add these words at the bottom of your letter: 
  
"Respectfully,
(your name)"
  
Read what you need to hear, in the true leader's voice: yours.
  
**Task 5. 15m, 0w**
  
Your original author may have had 
the authority, resources, or information you don't. 
For example, 
"Here's 20 thousand dollars 
to build your classroom." 
  
revise to make the letter practical.
  
Some tips:
1. for resources you don't have--
 money, time, influence--
accept that indeed, 
you do not have power over these things,
give up attempts to control,
and welcome your feelings.
  
2. for guiding your behavior--
decisions, actions, confidence--
give permission to take action.
  
## Back to the Garden
The next morning you woke 
to a field in disarray
and a letter.
You had worked harder than you planned,
and still fell short of your goal.
"If you did more than you would have
without the bet,
you won something,
including evidence that
there is some commitment in you
to make your dreams come true."

The biggest reward
is not a positive one:
you should accept you failed,
and, in part, 
due to a miscalculation.
Such a failure suggests 
other aspects of your plan
are likely misguided, and

the goal is further than
you estimated. 
If you disagree,
let's bet again.
Otherwise, 
to fix your miscalculated life plans,
you'll need  
the Intellectual Bootcamp.
