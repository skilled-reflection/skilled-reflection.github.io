(How would your life look 
if you put it on paper?)

## to Applicant  
  
How do you  
get what you need and want?   
How do you  
clarify and direct your life?   

With better words.   
The right words will change 
your actions and your life.  
It's time to live a better life.   
It starts with your words.

1.Is there a better version of you?  
2.Are you capable of moving toward it?  
3.Are you ready?  

## L5: Self  

## Focus
your identity
is a star (point),
seen from the eyes of reality,
feet of progress underneath you.

Habit of strength needed
to take the right steps,
keen eyes to optimize course
focused mind to steady the foot.

### Attention  
Everything is meant plainly.   
simply pay attention.   

If you get confused, forget it, 
pay attention to right now.  
  
### Thinking  

Our goal here is thinking.   
Thinking happens in your heads.   
In order to do something about it,   
we need to think on paper.   
[You'll write a lot. 
You'll delete a lot.  
You'll get good at writing.]  
  
### Time  

You'll get good at thinking.
[but not because of your attention]

attention is not reliable.   
The clock is. 
The clock is a cue to think.  
When it goes off, 
get back on task (pay attention).  
  
### Truth  
READER, there is 
some truth in you,
and some bull.

Much of it you can discern
by paying attention.
focus on the Truth in you.  

Skilled Reflection
will help you improve.

## READER

listening to another person.   

Read to assess your BET on 
whether these words reflect TRUTH.
Ask yourself if it is true for:  
1-the author.   
2-you. Ask yourself how you saw the world before,  
and after reading.   
3-others. Ask if this generalizes to others.
