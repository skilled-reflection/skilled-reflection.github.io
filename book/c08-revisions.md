## Chapter 8.	Revisions 

### Skilled Reflection

1.	[50,51,56,57] The GOAL of WORDS is to express ideas of  maximum 
CAKE tomorrow. 
2.	Since few WORDS meet these criteria, start by revising toward fewer 
WORDS.
3.	Make IDEAS clear and concrete. 
4.	Provide just enough CONTEXT to remember the basis of the key ideas.
5.	Precision depends on purpose. 
5.1.	LIST. Name relevant ideas for GOAL.
5.2.	WRITE a PLAN, (ordered LINKS).
5.3.	DOUBT. Assert the strongest rebuttal to the PLAN.
5.4.	BET. Improve IDEAS and LINKS by addressing weakness and 
clarity. 
5.5.	READ. Wager its CAKE (e.g., Relative to another PLAN).
6.	When reflecting, reflect only on "how can I help my future SELF?" And 
impose TIME and WORD limits.
7.	A bad doc is  stream-of-consciousness.

8.	Prompts elicit conflicts (truth) between SELF and NORM, to improve 
PLANS for your GOALS. 
9.	TIME and WORD limits WORK together to encourage a balance 
between reflecting on truth and describing it.

10.	WORD limits combat needless WORDS and distracting tangents. A 
WORD limit keeps your attention.
11.	A WORD limit  is a proxy for its complexity.
12.	Try to write the exact number of WORDS. 
13.	Good WORD limits require cutting out unhelpful WORDS, change 
figurative WORDS to concrete, ideally assertive and falsifiable.
14.	For every PLAN you make: Assert a WORD limit before writing, to be 
reminded of your initial intentions, and be challenged to express ideas 
clearly. Become skilled at using only the fewest WORDS necessary, to 
reveal and clarify CAKE.
15.	If you exceed the limit and there is no end in sight, stop and reassess.
16.	The TIME limit dictates how precise your WORDS should be. 
17.	Use extra TIME to improve WORD choice. 
18.	For example, given a 50-WORD limit, 1 minute (1m, 50w) encourages 
free writing with minimal restrictions on quality of thought, while 4 
minutes encourages more careful selection of WORDS.
19.	LESSONS are an ordered set of prompts, usually three to four, up to 60 
minutes and 250 WORDS. A prompt's WORD count is the number of 
WORDS to be added to your document.
20.	Lessons target inconsistencies between reality and PRIS.
21.	They are designed to be revisited and revised repeatedly.
22.	A 0w prompt means revise, but do not increase the WORD total.
23.	The first prompts in LESSONS are warm-ups to direct your attention. 
They ask for names of IDEAS.
24.	The remaining prompts are for thinking, requiring you to make LINKS 
between your warm-up IDEAS. Done right, you will face some new 
truths.

#### REVISE  

25.	Revise WORDS to improve actions of yourself or others is REVISION.
26.	REVISION is how we know reflection is happening, described here in 
VERSIONS (v#) of a response.
27.	For example, consider the following revisions (v1-3) describing this 
brief argument: 

1: "Nobody follows doctors' orders."
2: "My parents do, religiously."
1: "They're the exception."
2: "You're not exposed to minorities."

       v1:  
a)	1 makes a false generalization.
b)	2 illustrates a counterpoint, and 1 gets mad.
c)	1 dismisses it, and 2 gets mad. 

       v2:  
a)	1 generalizes from WORK experience.
b)	2 argues with parents' experience, and 1 gets mad.
c)	1 dismisses and 2 get mad. 

       v3:  
a)	1 argues outside 2's experience.
b)	2 uses personal experience, thinking it's impenetrable.
c)	Failing and hurt, 2 insults.

28.	The example aims to illustrate revisions which increase the amount of 
responsibility, control, and preventable future behavior on part of the 
writer, without much change in WORD count.
29.	Good revisions better describe what we know to have happened, and 
predict what will happen (again). 
30.	Reality is what determines whether each version is better.
31.	Revise prior prompt responses only to help your current prompt 
response.
32.	If your GOAL deals with different assumptions about the truth, change 
the prompt to whatever gets you to write the most helpful WORDS for 
your GOAL. 
32.1.	For example, a prompt referring to University student 
experiences should be adapted for your non-University 
experiences.
32.2.	A common (problematic) assumption is that you are emotionally 
ready to be SELF-critical.
32.3.	Do not change the prompt so you can be lazy.
33.	NOTES are general PLANS for REVISION. (Available on request.)
34.	Peer revision is a powerful learning tool. Get answers from others.
34.1.	Forget who provides REVISION and how much. 
34.2.	The peer WRITER has uncompromised objectivity, and liberty to 
employ Truth, however "harsh".

#### DOC

35.	A Recipe is one of the best ways to arrange PLANS.
36.	Lessons and instructions use a RECIPE format. 
37.	The RECIPE format highlights the IDEAS and LINKS of your point and 
minimizes excessive STYLE.
37.1.	List key IDEAS.
37.2.	Describe actions and transformations (LINKS).
38.	Given an IDEA, estimate relevance to PRIS, problems, undeveloped 
PLANS, and SELF-MAINTENANCE.
39.	Keep docs short enough that the title and CONTENT address only one 
thing.
40.	Save selectively and
41.	delete frequently.

### Communication

42.	RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDS is easier than RETRIEVAL from 
memory, of WORDS to write. Is- savings on revision.
43.	Only save docs that you BET will be useful enough later to save TIME, 
overall.
44.	Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE. 
This is the primary type of COMM we engage in.
45.	COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other 
examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are 
rereading, a carefully crafted party invite, or a Lease Agreement.
46.	The GOAL of COMM is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the 
inherent and practical problems that arise.

47.	Writing a WORD creates a static record of a WORD. 
48.	The problem of COMM is the difference in meaning between READER 
and WRITER of the same WORD. 
49.	Even if you wrote the WORD, your later SELF may read a different 
meaning for that WORD. 
50.	No person is identical with a future or past SELF, with any other 
person, and all of these relationships are in part UNKNOWN. 
51.	GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues. 
52.	BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the COST of clarity and 
honesty.
53.	PPL vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can 
vary in 
53.1.	precise understanding of meanings.
53.2.	TRUST (usually WRITER more than READER). 
54.	The real world is particular; each experience is an EXAMPLE. 
55.	A WORD describes a set of similar experiences. 
55.1.	WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of 
the real world.
55.2.	A WORD's definition is a generalization. 
56.	As such, WORDS are 
56.1.	less precise than reality.
56.2.	better designed to hypothesize and predict.
57.	To improve COMM, study the difference between CONTENT and STYLE.

### Styles

58.	PRIS between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
59.	Difference in PRIS alter CONTENT of ideas.
60.	Good STYLE is change in WORDS to minimize change in ideas between 
READER and WRITER.
61.	Versions describe identical CONTENT with difference in STYLE between 
them. 
62.	A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of the (same) final DOC.
63.	For example, you today vs you in five years.
64.	COMM-PPL assumes READING and WRITING have no intrinsic GOALS. 
65.	A DOC's arguments for why to READ it are a STYLE called PITCH. 
66.	Pitch can be accomplished, for example, by
66.1.	stroking the ego and intelligence of the reader.
66.2.	framing attacks as agreeable observations.
67.	The maximum common SELF-PRIS across PPL are the optimal 
arguments for PITCH. E-FOOD vs. CAKE.
68.	PPL who do not distinguish FOOD from CAKE will not be persuaded by 
PITCH.
69.	Therefore, they will be compelled more by lies. 
70.	BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth, a form of bad STYLE.

### Library

71.	LIB is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you WRITE, SAVE, 
and READ, by organizing it for best application, and providing feedback 
to help your future decisions to WRITE, SAVE, and READ.
72.	The scope of LIB is the collection of your WORDS over a lifetime. 
73.	is post-WRITING cache to facilitate future production.
74.	LIB is to docs as HOME is to possessions.
75.	LIB aims to maximize the CAKE of WORDS you save, and ideally, 
reduce future efforts to PLAN and accomplish PRIS, through making 
the best of your thoughts easy to find.
76.	A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation, none of which 
helped PLANS.
77.	A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.
78.	Library = sum (GOALS + PLANS) / 1
79.	For learning what you don't know you don't know.
80.	Potential risks include 
80.1.	writing, saving, and finding bad docs. 
80.2.	failure to save or find good docs.
81.	Studying links will improve ideas.
82.	PLANS, and anything else you write down, should be part of a PRI.
83.	Facilitate RETRIEVAL: 
83.1.	Index (list) docs worth rereading. 
83.2.	Assign a number that indicates its relative importance (abs or 
relative weight). 
83.3.	Add tags and metadata for easier sorting.
83.4.	Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s). Record and study LIB 
RETRIEVAL patterns.
84.	Note the TIME and date now, as you did in the introduction.
Graduate
85.	This is the end of the book. 
86.	Put it in your library.
87.	Now return to your garden and WORK on your PRIS.

#### Reference system
88. Well, what LIB would be complete without
89. a reference index? 
90. The equivalent of the Dewey system
91. mine is a reference of space-and-time:
91.1. Space: this book's chapter and line numbering, and
91.2. Time: v2.14 the current book version.
92. For example, a document that elaborates about trump would begin titled "c4.23 v2.14", giving the relevant chapter_number.idea_number in the version 2.14.
93. In that version of SR, 4 is the chapter PPL, and number 23 is the definition of RLTP. Trump, the article topic, is an example.
94. this is the header format for any subsequent document of an idea I write.

#### The Answerword

95. The complete set of PPL's LIBs is sufficiently exhaustive to describe all that matters in each and all lives. 
96. The efficiently compressed content of this LIB produces a distribution of variation along a median LIB. 
97. This is the content of the next book, "Answerword."
98. That book, then optimized to maximize the most learning, determines its STYLE.


### Index of Definitions
99. below are the chapter and line numbers for IDEA definitions, alphabetical.

00. Okay you got me, that's a promise and this is a placeholder for a future version that fulfills the promise. Start the clock: 2022-03-09-2129
