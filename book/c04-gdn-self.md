## The Garden: Self

Imagine your life is a garden. 
Every one of your life ambitions, GOALS,  
is buried in the ground as seeds.  
Finding a life partner, 
acquiring a car or promotion, or 
resolving a conflict with 
your childhood friend 
are all matters spread across the  
dirt in need of water, sunlight, 
and---most important---your time. 

Other goals, like naps, 
your favorite hobbies, or TV shows, 
take little work and  
grow almost anywhere.   
Whether they are dear to you or weeds,   
if they take your time, 
they are in your garden.  
  
Today, you are on one end looking out across the  
entire garden.   
What has already been planted? 
What will you add and how  
much time will you devote to those goals?   
Every seed you plant
---  even an abstract one 
like passing a course or making a friend---  
implies things 
in and out of your control 
like work and weather, or 
beyond your awareness,
like what your boss loses sleep over.  
  
Meditate on the final products of your garden.   
Is there a more important plant 
that deserves your time today?   

Meditate on the prioririties of your work.   
Do two plants grow better when together?   

Make a quick and accurate assessment,    
but don't sit here all morning 
thinking about it.  
A garden is for working in,
to get the goods you need.
What do you need to cultivate, 
today?  
What do you want to cultivate 
in this life?   
  
First, 
you want 
what your body and mind best respond to. 
Many of these seeds  
will be obvious. 
It is up to you how curious you are 
for what better life is possible.  

The only way to know is to make the best  
assessment you can about past outcomes to make predictions about what  
new seeds or gardening techniquest you should try. 
You don't have enough  
time in the day to tend to try everything, 
and many are not worth  
trying. 
There is not always harm 
to planting something that does not  
grow, but sometimes there is.
---you could run out of space, time, or  
energy that could have been devoted to better crops; 
you might get a  
weak yield 
for trying to grow something 
not suitable in your climate, or  
find you have no taste or stomach 
for the fruit.  
  
In the garden, the COSTS of goals 
are grounded in their most basic  
sense: time and attention.  


## IDEAS and PLANS
### GOAL
A GOAL  
- names a problem,   
- comprises a PLAN for an ideal outcome, and   
- has COSTS associated with exercising the PLAN.   
- can be 
  - finite and singular or persistent and recurring.   
  - REALITY or FANTASY.  
  
### PLAN
Words that might
improve the chance and   
decrease the cost 
of achieving your GOAL.  

PLAN types:  
1.  INSTR. Instructions for learning, making, changing, reminding.  
2.  DOC. Document-based GOALs, like manuscripts and resumes.  
  
PLAN templates:  
1.  LESSONs. For thinking. Read and complete steps in order.   
2.  TOOLs. Physical or mental objects.  
  
### Self
Every day, as a human, 
you spend time and attention
just meeting basic needs:
eating, drinking, pooping, and  
sleeping. 

SELF is what's necessary and sufficient
to manage CHUD,
and maximize BETs.

FITNESS is ALIGNING CHUD toward CAKE.
  
SELF optimizes bodily homeostasis   
- Eating,   
- sleeping,   
- pooping,   
- showering,   
- making babies, and   
- staying alive   
in order to maximize your values.  

While all humans must engage
with each,
each human's CHUD
will dictate how much.

### (GROUPS)  
SELF is grouped by GOALs of your body:   
Being fed, well-rested, and unstressed.  

### HOME  
A HOME groups associated actions by place: 
storing food,  
providing running water, 
and protection from the elements.   

All physical material and  
resources you own, including MONEY; and
environment and basis for HABITS.

A good HOME is a PLAN for SELF;  
simplifying the GOALS of   
eating, sleeping, and other basic needs.   
A bad HOME facilitates bad HABITs.

### VALUES
Anything fulfilling,  
including the reason for living.   

VALUES are a good basis for GOALS.
When they are immediately available,
they are called CAKE. 

  
## Lesson: Self250  
  
How accurately can you describe yourself?  
Relate to those who care,  
including your better self,  
by practicing the right words.  
  
### A. SELF-past  
Task 1. 20m, 250w  
  
Look back on your life.   
What are your values, and  
where did they come from?  
  
### B. SELF-future    
  
Where are you going?   
Imagine your life plays out  
- ideally,  
- terribly, and  
- typically.  
  
Consider  
1.  What could go right or wrong,  
2.  What it depends on and the likelihood.  
3.  Who you will be if it happens.  
  
Create a "choose your adventure", ordered by likelihood.  
  
For example:  
  
80% make enough money to be content.  
50% marry, and  
- 50:50 ends well or in divorce.  
10% major accident leading to depression.  
  
### C. SELF-now   
Task 3. (20m, 250w)  
  
If you have not done **Lesson: Times**,   
skim it.  
  
Task 3a. 2m, 50w.  
  
Choose a goal you named in **Self-Future ** with   
a probability of outcome that   
you would like to increase.   
What change is needed   
in your daily schedule   
to make this increase?  
  
List the activities and durations   
you will reduce or increase.  
  
Task 3b. 3m, 50w.  
  
List most likely reasons this plan fails,   
especially reverting back to old habits.  
  
Task 3c. 10m, 150w.  
  
Add steps to create and protect changes in your schedule.  
  
Task 3d. 1m, [decide-date]  
  
Bet on this (Task 3b vs 3c).   
Set a date on the calendar   
to assess your commitment to this plan.   
  

## L8: Food vs Cake  
In your life,
you have many experiences
that seem separate,
and often what makes it so
is how the experience
relates to your priorities
and immediate desires.

So, some experiences
you know you will have
can be dreaded, 
while others dreamed of.

For example, a full time college student
often comes to dread midterms
and dream of spring break. 
Each are about one week long  
with a clear end, 
and both are part of a student's life.  

The problem is that
these anticipations
can create avoidable
disappointment.

This is an exercise
to reduce simplistic speculation
and its harmful effects
on your behavior and perception.

If you like your life,
do more of what you like
when you most need it,
try to appreciate what you dread,
and all the imperfections.

**Task 1. 4m, 50w.**  
  
List 4 goals to accomplish for midterms, before spring break  
  
**Task 2. 4m, 50w.**  
  
List 4 goals for the best spring break you can imagine.  
  
**Task 3. 15m, 200w.**  
  
There are only so many hours in a day. What aspects of self-care can you  
incorporate during your midterms to improve your sanity, and hopefully  
your midterm performance? We know what happens if you don't. You're  
staring at your phone, you're reading random articles on the internet  
and wasting time. Let's take that same honest realism and intentionally  
plan better alternatives: instead of garbage breaks, how about spring  
breaks? In what strategic ways can you get a head start on your spring  
break goals, as a form of self-care and therapy during your marathon of  
midterm work?  
  
Write out your midterm goals with self-care and/or spring break  
strategically built in.  
  
**Task 4. 15m, 200w.**  
  
Now imagine that spring break more fully. You're spending time on one of  
your goals, when suddenly you remember something you need to do for  
midterms. Maybe you get an email from your instructor or boss, or  
there's a project that looms large.  
  
What are you going to do to be okay with this intrusion? Would it help  
to allow some time to work on it, without feeling guilty or beating  
yourself up, or is it vital that you embrace your independent needs and  
resist any urge to do work? Regardless of how you might ideally respond,  
incorporate compassion toward yourself for how you might end up  
responding, including feeling anxious for the entirety of spring break.  
  
Write out your spring break goals with midterm goals incorporated.
