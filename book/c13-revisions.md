### RLTP--Peers  
*push-revision*
Peer review is a powerful learning tool.

The peer WRITER 
works with uncompromised objectivity, 
and liberty to employ Truth, 
however subjectively "harsh".

### Scientist    

A scientist WORKs to win BETS against the UNKNOWN. 
They are a professional writer, 
evaluated on two metrics:

1.For their MEMES of CONTENT.
2.The net benefit of their MEMES on GOAL outcomes.

A scientist-researcher is a WRITER, 
a data-collector and hypothesis tester. 
A scientist-scholar is a READER,
curating toward theory development and COMM.

### Scholar    

a professional READER and 
Peer-Reviewer,
especially in curating the Scientist's insights.

evaluated by repost statistics 
(others as readers),  
akin to evaluating twitter users by their retweets.

PEERs: 
Forget *who* provides REVISION and how much. 
Get answers from others.

## Change your thoughts. Change your life.
[reprise of title page]()

Comprehension is involuntary.
You cannot help but recognize meaning 
if you see or hear language.
This likely means that
your involuntary response
to this section title 
was something like,
"Easier said than done."

Sometimes real meaning requires voluntary thought.
Often, all it takes is a
seemingly incompatible pair
of ideas.
For example,
this time when you
think about the title,
assume it is a reasonable,
serious, 
seriously valuable suggestion.
All it would take is for you
to honestly believe you can.

## COMM

COMM deals with the complexity of PPL and WORDs.
COMM is the exchange of WORDS with other PPL.

#### Ambiguity 1: PPL
Because PPL vary in PRIs,
they vary in
how they apprehend the world,
and therefore in precise meanings.

#### Ambiguity 2: COMM
As individuals with distinct PRIs,
there may be distinct,
potentially conflicting
motives.
READER and WRITER
will vary in how much they
TRUST COMM.

#### Ambiguity 3: WORDS
The real world is
particular;
each experience is an EXAMPLE.
A WORD describes groups of experiences in common,
whether an IDEA or LINK.
As such,
WORDS are always
less precise than reality.

WORDs are never definite and certain
in what they describe
of the real world.

A word's definition is a generalization.
Thus, WORDS are better designed 
to hypothesize and predict.

`x-PRI`
Two people with identical PRIs see the world identically.
To improve COMM, study the difference
between CONTENT and STYLE.

### DOC

Studying LINKs will improve
IDEAs and BETs in your life.

PLANs, and anything else you write down,
should be part of a PRI.

Given an IDEA:
1.Estimate relevance to
  - PRIs,
  - problems,
  - undeveloped PLANS,
  - SELF-MAINTENANCE

2.Keep DOCs short enough that
the title and CONTENT address 
only one thing.

3.Save selectively and  

4.delete frequently.  

### STYLE, VERSION

PRIs between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
Difference in PRIs alter CONTENT of IDEAs.

Good STYLE is change in WORDs to minimize change in IDEAs
between READER and WRITER.
 
VERSIONs describe identical CONTENT
with difference in STYLE between them.

you today vs you in five years (LIB).

A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of
the (same) final DOC.
 
Some STYLE addresses those who
fail to appreciate READING and WRITING.

NORMS (COMM-PPL) typically requires
editing words to:
 
1.  Stroke ego and intelligence of others;
2.  Frame attacks as agreeable observations.
 
SELF IDEAs are the most STYLE-free.
e-FOOD and CAKE.

Bad style is BRAND, 
STYLE that intentionally simplifies or obscures relevant
LINKs to an IDEA.

## SR

The value of words (meaning)
depends on TIME.
WRITING is for READING.
as TIME passes
DOC becomes subject to COMM issues.

The GOAL of words is to express IDEAs that
will retain their value tomorrow.

Work to make IDEAS clear and concrete.
Put IDEAS at the top of a DOC.
Provide just enough CONTEXT
to remember the basis of the key IDEAs.
 
Precision depends on purpose.

1.  LIST. Name relevant IDEAs for GOAL.
2.  WRITE a PLAN, (ordered LINKS).
3.  DOUBT. Assert the strongest rebuttal to the PLAN.
4.  BET. Improve IDEAS and LINKS
      by addressing weakness and clarity.
5.  READ. Wager its value (e.g. relative to another PLAN).

Always reflect to address the question,
How can I help my future self?
and impose time and word limits.
 
A bad doc begins with
stream-of-consciousness.

#### PROMPTS
Prompts elicit conflicts (truth)
between SELF and NORM,
to improve PLANS for your GOALS.
TIME and WORD limits work
together to encourage a balance
between reflecting on truth and describing it.

### WORD_CT

DOCs revisited and revised later are
better with fewer words.

Word limits combat needless words and
distracting tangents.
A word limit keeps your attention.

Try to write the exact number of words.
Good word limits require
cutting out unhelpful words,
change figurative words to concrete,
ideally assertive and falsifiable.

A DOC's word count is a proxy for
its complexity;

PLAN-
For every PLAN you make:
Assert a word limit before writing,
to be reminded of your initial intentions, and
be challenged to express IDEAs clearly.
Become skilled at using only the fewest words necessary,
to reveal and clarify VALUEs.

If you exceed the limit and
there is no end in sight,
stop and reassess.


#### TIME_LT
The **time limit** dictates
how precise your words should be.
Extra  time is for better words.
For example, a one-minute, 50-word limit
(1m, 50w)
encourages free writing
with minimal restrictions on quality of thought.
Conversely, a 4-minute, 40-word limit
(4m, 40w)
is meant to encourage
more careful selection of words.

#### LESSONS-SR
LESSONS are an ordered set of prompts,
usually three to four,
up to 60 minutes and 250 words.
A prompt's word count is the number
of words to be added to your document.

Note:
A 0w prompt means revise, but
do not increase the word total.

The first prompts in LESSONS are
warm-ups to direct your attention.
They ask for names of IDEAS.
 
The next prompts are for thinking,
requiring you to make LINKS between
your warm-up IDEAS.
Done right,
you will face some new truths.

### REVISE
REVISION is how we know reflection is happening,
described here in
VERSIONS (v\#) of a response.

EXAMPLE:
What caused this reaction?
 
Response-v1:
 
1.  I work hard on an intellectual activity.
2.  I'm not secure about it.
3.  Someone I admire undermines it.
 
Response-v2:
 
1.  I make something I think is well done.
2.  I expect validation.
3.  Criticism catches me off guard.

Version 1 is less generalizable.
Version 2 is more plain and verifiable,
making it more useful for PLANs.
 
You may also revise answers to prior prompts, but
only to keep up with or
help address the current prompt.

**Revise the prompt.**
The prompts encourage reflection,
but truth-seeking defines the prompt.

While reflecting you may uncover
truths less relevant to the prompt than to your GOALS.
Revise the prompt
in a way that best promotes development of the insight at hand.
This may be toward the end, or on the first prompt.
For example,
a prompt referring to University student experiences
should be adapted for your
non-University experiences.
 
Prompts can also be "irrelevant"
if they are too emotionally overwhelming,
for critical thinking.

Do not change the prompt so you can be lazy.
 
#### SAVE-if (LIB)  
RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDs is easier than
RETRIEVAL from memory, of WORDs to write.
is-an IDEA-REVISION SAVINGs.

Lessons are only valuable for the insights
that will make tomorrow helpful.
Lessons are designed to be
revised over time.

Only save and maintain DOCs that
will be useful enough later
to save time, overall.

Facilitate RETRIEVAL:
1.Index (list) DOCs worth rereading.
2.Assign a number that indicates its relative
importance (abs or relative weight).
3.Add tags and metadata for easier sorting.
4.Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s).
  Record and study LIB RETRIEVAL patterns.

### LIB
The collection of your WORDs over a lifetime.

A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.

`Library = sum(GOALS + PLANS) / 1`

for learning what you don't know you don't know.
A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation.
 
vs-whereas WORDS deals with involuntary IDEAs,
LIB is post-WRITING cache
to facilitate future production.

RISKs
1.FALSE POSITIVE: Writing, saving, and finding bad DOCs.
2.FALSE NEG: failure to save or find good DOCs.
