### Abstract (long)  
1-what one question and answer best guides each chapter?

This book asks and answers a series of questions about the nature of a productive life and its implications, as follows. 
[Self](c04-gdn-self.md). What is food, what must I do (FOOD) in order to have what I want (CAKE)? Food is health, comprising maximum physical energy (fit) and mental energy (wit). CAKE is motivation, meaning and will to live (PRI). 
[Pri](c05-gdn-pri.md). What actions maximize cake in my life? Efficient fit and wit maximally used, before death (plan).
[Ppl](c06-gdn-ppl.md). What are people? Parallel universes dealing with the identical problem set.
[Bet](c07-gdn-bet.md). What actions result in CAKE? Steps taken now according to my plan (bets) and revision according to bet wins and failures (CHUD).
[School](c09-ibc-ed.md). What now? Learn all your answers (student), along with other ppl (peers): go to school (ibc).
[Words](c12-words.md). What do i study? How to minimize the difference between your pri (words) and data (reality), or how to increase bet wins, and minimize their failures over your time as a student (data).
[Revisions](c13-revisions.md). When am i done? When your plan for bets is according to pris, prepared for CHUD is good enough to bet on (revision): as soon as possible (blitz).
[Epilogue](c14-calling.md). What is wrong with this book? It is mostly about idealized productivity, because it is written by one instructor obsessed with discipline and science fiction.
