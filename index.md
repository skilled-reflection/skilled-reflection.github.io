Here's a challenge: Try to [describe yourself](self250.md) in 250 words.  

## Skilled Reflection

Some things you care about more, 
so you spend more time on them, right?

If you're human, habits and reality
have a tendency to sneak between 
our intentions and actions.

A little Skilled Reflection 
applied once a week
to your values and actions
will smooth out the plan between the two. 

In practice, we're a Student Organization 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
that meets once a week to write privately for about an hour.

Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on.

Find us in the 2021 Badger Homecoming Parade!
