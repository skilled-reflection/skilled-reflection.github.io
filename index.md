## [An Identity Workbook](_book/index.html)

Skilled Reflection v2.15 is an abreviated manual of the tools that'll help you shape the precise SELF you're after without having to tell a single soul (some SELF-assembly required). 

## A Club
A journaling club with purpose: yours.

Habits and reality have a tendency to sneak between our intentions and actions.
A little Skilled Reflection will make reality more like your plan. 

For 3 years, we've been a Student Organization 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
that meets every few weeks to write privately for about an hour.
Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on.
