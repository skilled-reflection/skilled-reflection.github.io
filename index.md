## About Skilled Reflection

You care about some things more than others, and do some things more than others.

Skilled reflection is an attempt to clarify how your actions and values relate to each other, and make clear next-steps toward who you imagine yourself being.

Skilled Reflection is a Student Organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that meets once a week to write privately for about an hour.

Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on.

More than anything, the time and writing are commitments to better navigate our complex lives. To learn more, read about the orginization's start and mission in the [Psychology Department Bulletin](https://psych.wisc.edu/news/when-personal-experience-meets-psychology-michael-koranda/).
