## Club
A journaling club with purpose: yours.

Habits and reality have a tendency to sneak between our intentions and actions.
A little Skilled Reflection will smooth out the plan between your values and actions. 

We're a Student Organization 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
that meets once a week to write privately for about an hour.
Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on.

Read about us in the [Psychology Department Bulletin](https://psych.wisc.edu/news/when-personal-experience-meets-psychology-michael-koranda/).
