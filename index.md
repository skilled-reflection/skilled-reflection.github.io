Here's a challenge: Try to describe yourself in [250 words](self250.md).  

## Skilled Reflection  
A journaling club with purpose: yours.

If you're human, habits and reality
have a tendency to sneak between 
our intentions and actions.

A little Skilled Reflection 
will smooth out the plan between your values and actions. 

We're a Student Organization 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
that meets once a week to write privately for about an hour.

Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on.

Find us in the 2021 Badger Homecoming Parade!
