## [An Identity Workbook](_book/index.html)

![](figs/title.png)

## A Club
A journaling club with purpose: yours.

Habits and reality have a tendency to sneak between our intentions and actions.
A little Skilled Reflection will make reality more like your plan. 

For 3 years, we've been a Student Organization 
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
that meets every few weeks to write privately for about an hour.
Each session focuses on specific themes related to identity, goals, and being a student, with prompts for you to reflect and write on.

Read about us in the [Psychology Department Bulletin](https://psych.wisc.edu/news/when-personal-experience-meets-psychology-michael-koranda/).
