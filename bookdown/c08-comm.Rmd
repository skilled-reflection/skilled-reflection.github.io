# Communication

1.  Consider you meet someone in the woods, and have only 1m (approx.
    250w) to say the most essential thing.

2.  When you communicate (COMM), skip SELF and talk PRI. Convey the
    greatest amount of relevant information with greatest likelihood of
    understanding or convincing.

3.  PRI-COMM is the difference between your and NORM-PRI, especially
    that what your FOOD and CAKE are and why.

4.  Say:

    1.  properties of the answer, not knowing it,
    2.  an answer for purposes of improving on it.

5.  These properties are the properties of [SR][Skilled Reflection]:

    1.  comparable constraints to establish a reliable subjective
        experience.
    2.  until we have a measurable SELF and variation, share the SELF
        that is CAKE, in 250w.

## Problem

6.  Communication happens from one being to another.

7.  The function is to direct attention to a circumstance of high
    importance: sharing information.

8.  For example, the vervet screech that specifically means, "snake".

9.  While the vervet makes or hears calls about threats of immediate,
    nearby importance, the breadth of human communication can direct
    attention to circumstances of distant places and times.

10. This is an echo of the breadth of attention and information humans
    engage. for some reason entangled between information, sharing it,
    there is subjectivity of importance.

11. The consequence is ambiguity in the value of a communicative act.

## STYLE

12. RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDS is easier than RETRIEVAL from
    memory, of WORDS to write. Is- savings on revision.
13. Only save docs that you BET will be useful enough later to save
    TIME, overall.
14. Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE.
    This is the primary type of COMM we engage in.
15. COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other
    examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are
    rereading, a carefully crafted party invite, or a Lease Agreement.
16. The GOAL of COMM is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the
    inherent and practical problems that arise.

## COMM

17. Writing a WORD creates a static record of a WORD.
18. No person is identical with a future or past SELF, with any other
    person, and all of these relationships are in part UNKNOWN.
    ([c4.1][PPL])
19. The problem of COMM is the difference in meaning between READER and
    WRITER of the same WORD.
20. Even if you wrote the WORD, your later SELF may read a different
    meaning for that WORD.
21. GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues.
22. BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the COST of clarity and honesty.
23. PPL vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can
    vary in
    1.  precise understanding of meanings.
    2.  TRUST (usually WRITER more than READER).
24. The real world is particular; each experience is an EXAMPLE.
25. A WORD describes a set of similar experiences.
    1.  WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of
        the real world.
    2.  A WORD's definition is a generalization.
26. As such, WORDS are
    1.  less precise than reality.
    2.  better designed to hypothesize and predict.
27. To improve COMM, study the difference between CONTENT and STYLE.

## Difference

28. PRIS between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
29. Difference in PRIS alter CONTENT of ideas.
30. Good STYLE is change in WORDS to minimize change in ideas between
    READER and WRITER.
31. Versions describe identical CONTENT with difference in STYLE between
    them.
32. A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of the (same) final DOC.
33. For example, you today vs you in five years.

## NORMs

34. COMM NORMs assume READING and WRITING have no intrinsic GOALS.
35. A DOC's arguments for why to READ it are a STYLE called PITCH.
36. Pitch can be accomplished, for example, by
    1.  stroking the ego and intelligence of the reader.
    2.  framing attacks as agreeable observations.
37. The maximum common SELF-PRIS across PPL are the optimal arguments
    for PITCH. E-FOOD vs. CAKE.
38. BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth, a form of bad STYLE.
39. For example, consider the GOAL of describing the properties of
    **apples** with the purpose of selling them:
    1.  CONTENT: **Apples are healthy but sugary.**\
    2.  STYLE: **Apples are tasty and nutritious.**\
    3.  BRAND: **Apples are healthy.**\
40. PPL who do not distinguish FOOD from CAKE will be persuaded by BRAND
    more than PITCH.

## Library

39. LIB is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you WRITE,
    SAVE, and READ, by organizing it for best application, and providing
    feedback to help your future decisions to WRITE, SAVE, and READ.
40. The scope of LIB is the collection of your WORDS over a lifetime.
41. is post-WRITING cache to facilitate future production.
42. LIB is to docs as HOME is to possessions.
43. LIB aims to maximize the CAKE of WORDS you save, and ideally, reduce
    future efforts to PLAN and accomplish PRIS, through making the best
    of your thoughts easy to find.
44. A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation, none of which
    helped PLANS.
45. A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.
46. Library = sum (GOALS + PLANS) / 1
47. For learning what you don't know you don't know.
48. Potential risks include 40.1. writing, saving, and finding bad docs.
    40.2. failure to save or find good docs.
49. Studying links will improve ideas.
50. PLANS, and anything else you write down, should be part of a PRI.
51. Facilitate RETRIEVAL:
    1.  Index (list) docs worth rereading.
    2.  Assign a number that indicates its relative importance (abs or
        relative weight).
    3.  Add tags and metadata for easier sorting.
    4.  Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s). Record and study LIB
        RETRIEVAL patterns.
52. Note the TIME and date now, as you did in the introduction. Graduate
53. This is the end of the book.
54. Put it in your library.
55. Now return to your garden and WORK on your PRIS.

## Reference system

56. 

    1.  Space: this book's chapter and line numbering.
    2.  Time: v2.14 the current book version.

57. For example, a document that elaborates about Trump would begin
    titled "c4.23 v2.14".

58. In version 2.14 of SR, 4 is the chapter PPL, and number 23 is the
    definition of RLTP. Trump, the article topic, is an example.

59. This is the header format for any subsequent document of an idea I
    write.

## Answerword

60. The complete set of PPL's LIBs is sufficiently exhaustive to
    describe all that matters in each and all lives.

61. The efficiently compressed content of this LIB produces a
    distribution of variation along a median LIB.

62. This is the content of the next book, "Answerword."

63. In that book, STYLE is any further optimization to maximize
    learning.

64. Book 3, "Afterword", is the DARPA for thought when the Answerword is
    muscle-memory.

## Zero

65. Suppose you don't share the same language. What conventions of
    gesture, an international gesture meaning, might we have?
    1.  An object pointed to means: There it is; It is/will be mine; I
        want it; You want it;

## Your Calling, Part II

66. Tell me the missing chapter that gives peace instead of regimen, so
    that I may find mine.
