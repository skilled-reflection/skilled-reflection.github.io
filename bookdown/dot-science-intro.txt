I want to tell you a story.

Meet Dot.
Dot is you on a paper
on the science of humans.

first we have a map
of things in places over time.
this is a geological,
ecological, geographical map.

animals and ppl
move about it,
each a dot like you.

as a human,
a good initial theory
will be one that
predicts
where and for how long
and for what reasons
a dot moves from 
a location of one
of the following three types
to another:
1)their own place (owned or rented)
2)work
3)the market
- playground
- store

## intermission 2
eliza 2
should be pretty interesting
just off this kind of self-report.
