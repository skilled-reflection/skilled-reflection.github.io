## Places  

1. You have four places of life*.
    1. on your garden dealing with your SELF.
    2. at WORK making something for others for money.
    3. getting something someone else made (MARKET).
    4. on someone else's garden.
    
\*Sometimes you are at your garden's edge
looking elsewhere.
For example, when you read an email or social media feed,
as if looking across your neighbor's plot,
studying how to bring your lettuce back to life,
or celebrating your friend's successful pumpkin patch.

### Gateway to PRIs  

2. Despite garden-based PRIs, most of your time
is spent outside your garden, and mostly for WORK (about 80,000 hours in your life).
3. Acknowledge the PPL in your PRIs, yet don't let them distract.
4. Notice how long and to where you leave your garden.
5. Spend only as much time needed away for your PRIs.
6. When in doubt, go HOME and stare at your plants.

<!-- from these datum alone -->
<!-- we have all we need to know -->
<!-- as a psychological baseline -->
<!-- for each individual difference. -->

### WORK  

7.	Where do you get seeds for FOOD from and how did you know to plant them? 
8.	From other PPL, right? No silly, you don't know how to garden a sandwich! 
9.	Lucky for you, many of the most important crops you want are already grown, prepared and handed to you--in exchange for money.

10.	Money is traded for maintenance of, or insurance for SELF and CAKE, like apples, miracle medical procedures, and a toilet to take your poop somewhere else.
11. WORK is performing a specific task on a collective garden, like an institution's in exchange for money. It is a pre-arranged visit to another garden for a specified time.

12.	Whether or not you like it, or it directly fulfills garden needs, WORK is made to serve NORMS, not you.
13.	NORMS are all actions assumed of (or about) the "average" person. They are the web of FORCES of all actions of all PPL, including WORK, religion, popular attitudes, and DOUBTS.

#### mental work  
14. if you have a job that pays you to think, your mind is hired to make NORM products real.
15. Instead of your reality, 
you'll translate to NORMS's reality, CHUD-adjusted.

16.	NORMS assume you will WORK for money for goods. 
17.	Language, agreed usage of WORDS, is made from NORMS.
18.	NORMS push against individuality (except where it provides a lucrative job opportunity). 

19.	A FORCE is any cause of change. 
   1.	A FORCE underlies every action involved in a GOAL, yours or otherwise.
   2.	There are forces within your control, and forces outside.
20.	MAINTENANCE is the COST of FORCE to neither move toward nor 
away from a GOAL. 
21.	ALIGNMENT is when NORM or natural FORCE causes your GOAL to be more likely.
    1.	To ALIGN is to adjust your GOAL to be more like another force, usually one acting against your GOAL. 
    2.	Study how forces WORK against you. 

22.	Relationships (RLTP) are GOALS about PPL (PPL). 
23.	Good ones are aligned with your GOALS.
24.	Bad ones COST more. 
25.	A RLTP is a reciprocal pair of BETS, yours of them, and vice versa. One is the better and the other is the bet and bet on.
26.	RLTPS, especially family members, coordinate many GOALS for SAVINGS.

### PPL's Gardens 

27.	Just like you, others are trying to figure out what goes in their garden.\*	PPL are different VERSIONs of each others' PRI ([see also c9.70][NORMs STYLE]).

28. Maybe they are your friend, and need help with some unruly vines, or maybe you just like their apples. 
29. Sometimes, PPL will contribute to your goals, as if bringing water to crops you didn't recognize need them. 4. Sometimes PPL will try to water your crops when they don't need watering.
30. Sometimes you'll return with higher morale or a bag of apples.
31. Sometimes you'll need to water some crops that need to be watered, because the sight of their neglect cannot be ignored.
32. The challenges that overwhelm you are the same for others, just not always the same amount nor at the same time.
33. The place, duration and impact on your PRIs are the basic measurements of a RLTP.

34.	Pick WORK and RLTP that maximize your other PRIS including possibly 
one that maximizes TIME and money to apply to other PRIS.
35.	Pick friends the same way. 
36.	Consider your actions and choices about PPL carefully. 
37.	Maximally ALIGN with NORMS with least compromise to PRIs. (Get along with PPL.)

## The Classroom  

**Note: Revisit this section after "Ed".**

38. A CLASSROOM is a special case of MARKET and WORK is the direct and shared exchange of mental work, for the purpose of improving individual PRIs.
39.	(No one chose to be born.) 
40.	Everyone begins life with their own unnamed and unanswered 
problems.
41.	Books can only tell a student what the answer is not (quite).
42.	The gap between problem and book answers is left for the student to "apply".
43.	A better approach would be to let the student define the problem through their reality and life GOALS.
44.	Let them write the PLAN and teach them only what is needed to succeed.
45.	Imagine a perfect course exists, designed to teach you to fulfill your specific ambitions. 
46.	Every aspect of what you NEED to know, that is known and 
communicable, is the only thing written. 
47.	Everything that cannot be known but must be discovered or practiced, is laid out as a set of instructions, described in the WORDS that maximize the learning opportunity, and your progress.
48.	Rather than a course in a classroom, the perfect class is a manual to reference as you live your life, or at least until you've internalized its contents: 
49.	when to take a break to strategize your decisions, lessons on what opportunities to watch for and resist, and so on. 
50.	Any social role you wish to take on, artist, engineer, therapist, insurance salesperson, reliable partner, is customized intimately, curated perfectly for what you need.
51.	Any RLTP or interpersonal skill that is realistically possible for you is preceded with the guidance and education that prepares you emotionally to choose the right experiences that set you up to be most likely to find and make the most of opportunities to share yourself with another.

52. People, are the part of PRIs that require the most care, and least words. 
53. Whereas actions unconsciously imply BETs, a bad NORM is HYPED mutual BETs (unaligned with actions).
54. Instead, a RLTP is a CONTRACT of the reciprocated actions (USE).
