## Reality

You can take control of your life, or you can let the world bet for you. 
Perfect betting is "rational behavior," something rare for humans.

Betting is a protocol to keep you close to reality, and keep your goals relevant.
To be better at betting is the safest universal bet on yourself.
How real will your dreams get before you die?  

Betting is a plan to confront costs, habits, unknowns and doubts (CHUD) that contrast with your priorities.
The passing time and the status of your goal are an intersection of the world and you. 
Every idea you hold is a bet with a rolling deadline, idiosyncratic successes, and revisions.

## Act  

Do it.

## Win

If you make it happen before sun-up, you'll be over the most daunting hurdle between you and your outcome.
you have changed your habit as promised.
You advance your plan, and reduce distance to your goal. 


## Lose

Any attempt at least validates your interest from being a complete lie. 
Still, the key value of losing is a wake-up call to be more realistic.
you have lost a day of your life.

## Bet  {#bet-bet}  

To bet, name:

1. A step in your plan,
2. A deadline to achieve it, and
3. The CHUD for that duration.
4. Act to win, and note your actions.

## After  

compare where you are, and where you need to go next.
Update your next bet according to the successes and failures of this one.
repeat.

When the deadline arrives, take stock.
1. Compare your action log to your plan.
2. Identify CHUD factors that best explain discrepancies.
3. Revise plan, updated with CHUD factor predictions.
4. (Record time to do the next bet or goal, revise, etc.)
5. Start the next bet or goal.  

## Cost  

Everything in life costs time or effort.
You must be in a certain place, take action, and often give up something.
For example, physical effort or money. 

Self is the basic cost of living your life.
Costs are not bad unless they are against your priorities.

Costs only pertain to what actually happens. 
To bet requires estimating costs.

## Habits  

Habit is the basic pattern of actions you have taken, 
whether toward your priorities or toward suffering.
Habit is the rational, descriptive summary of your history.
Habit serves as the rational prediction of your bet outcomes.
Regardless of how expensive your habit, a change of habit is always an added and difficult cost.
That is, unless and until the change becomes a habit.

Suppose in the last 3 days I ate at 9 am.
If tomorrow is a day like the last three, habit predicts I will eat before 9 am.
It also predicts that this is the lowest cost action.


## Unknowns  

Unknowns are all that are fully out of your control (i.e., statistical error).
For example, planning a drive that doesn't account for a train crossing delay. 

Unknowns are the difference between your real and estimated costs and habits.
Bet to learn them.


## Doubts  
Imagine achieving all your priorities, right now.
When considering the costs, note to the fears that surface.
Never mind the world, how are you in your own way?
These are doubts.

Doubts are reliable patterns of failure.
See your doubts with curiosity. 

For example:
- self-fulfilled prophesies
- over- or under-estimating habits
- anxiety or insecurity 
- distrust in your past

A strong bet is partly made in terms of what you think holds you back most.
