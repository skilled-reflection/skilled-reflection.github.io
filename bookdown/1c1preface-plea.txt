1-once we thought words do two things: relay idea or rltp-pri; yet linguists and phils know thinking is in a box we cannot relay to life.  the reader fixates on wit, forgets fit.
2-to bridge wit and fit, i sought to order the world by fit.
3-yet from there i saw the reflection of words, reflection of mind, a simulator of 4 or 5 lenses. these lenses are not all good. though in practice their subject is unspecified, i propose order for wit to facilitate lang.
