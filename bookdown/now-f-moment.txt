moment

## now-f
(style is to put now-f first)
now is the only use-case
of shared space, in time.

## moment-f
any now that is not the latest.
- either future or past.

bod-
universal viewpoint
future relevance.


## bod-f
benefit of doubt
assumptions of use, example to reveal maximum potential

## moment-f2
a record of now becomes past 'nows'
of variable use-case(1).

we might reflect on the previous
nows that we shared.

in seeing passage,
we might speculate on future
nows to be shared.

the discourse of past or future
is always at least partially hype,
but real (use) when bet on.


(1)though initially use-cases,
mis-replayed, misunderstood, 
permanently changed now-pri
degrades them to hype.
