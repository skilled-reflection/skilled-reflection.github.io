## intro
two people meet in the woods.
suppose i have only 30s to tell you the most essential thing.

perhaps you and i can skip 
SELF and talk PRI.
but I need to know what your FOOD and CAKE are and why.

i'll propose properties of the answer, not knowing it,
and i'll propose an answer for purposes of improving on it.

the properties are that of sr: comparable constraints, to establish a reliable subjective experience. until we have a measurable SELF and variation, i bet two people should simply share the

SELF that is CAKE.
in 250.

## basic problem and plan  
init 440 words, 2021-05-20-2350

communication happens from one being to another,
like the vervet screech that specifically means, "snake".
the function is to direct attention to a circumstance of high importance: 
sharing information.

while the vervet makes or hears calls about threats of immediate, nearby importance,
the breadth of human communication can direct attention to circumstances of
distant places and times. 
- this is an echo of the breadth of attention and information humans engage.
for some reason entangled between information, sharing it, there is subjectivity of importance.
the consequence is ambiguity in the value of a communicative act.

my central interest is two-sided. on the one hand, it is imperative that i work to preserve the value inherent in communication, by preserving the following truth: 
humans using language 
1) have information valuable to a listener
2) they want to share.

most of the work is in encouraging people who speak because 2 is more evident than 1. 
i do this work because it is the closest relative of social value- and thus material benefit to-the thing i would rather invest in, the other side of my interest:
the potentiality of making a dream of a better language, become real.
what is a better language?
better is either easier to use given the same benefit or clearer to benefit from given the same difficulty to say and understand it.
i'm interested in this on the assumption that such ease invites noticing and attending to yet better information, and as a result, lives lived longer and more stress free of snakes.

i want you to share this value, but i don't believe you can yet, 
so let us return to how to better use our existing communication:

1) know what you're attending to, that you intend to communicate.
2) when communicating, make explicit the pre-existing assumption your information improves on. this is your call of "snake", relative to the absence of one, implying the lack of snakes in the grass. 
3) aim to approximate this level of value with the utterance, and especially published recording of, your words. 
with enough people, hopefully, we'll test the potential to intentionally grow language.

i hope these words are 
1) but the first of mine 
2) valuable to the systematic improvement of sharing information.

## ask and tell
1. comm non-atomic links with sayings - quotes.

a wants what b knows

lang coordinates.

naturally, all referents observable in the world.

it struggles at instances of the qualia problem.

### aware
when 
1-a does not have internal_state_1 (is1) and
2-b has is1,

what lets A know 
Q1- 2
Q2- b knows 1 and 2

what is style( B -> A )?
- reality-A =? reality-B
(as it currently reads, this question is *actually* how do we, C, know that... Q1 and Q2. better to reframe as A == I, writer, and B == you, reader; or similar)

### agency
B knows his own example of
PLAN, what changed 1 to 2.

can B's PLAN be
Q3-used by A?
Q4-explainable to A (given 1)?
and worthwhile (faster than A, otherwise)?

### communicable
what lets
- A and B trust B can provide PLAN for A to move from 1 to 2?

intuition says what 
expert needs to say to 
novices is
what to do.

contrast this with
for how long.

the raw measure of efficacy is as follows:

instr-recipe 
10m blitz conditions
1-emphasize ingredient and task list
2-emphasize quantity, size, duration of task, focus distribution

# claim
1-misleading shape-bias; "false cognates"
novice over fixates on what is distinct (shape bias).
expert only is aware that some distinct things are as easy as familiar,
whereas some almost-familiar shapes might be unusually difficult.
- false cognates.

2-misleading intersection
- false familiarity based on object and verb; combo is unfamiliar.
