two people meet in the woods.
suppose i have only 30s to tell you the most essential thing.

perhaps you and i can skip 
SELF and talk PRI.
but I need to know what your FOOD and CAKE are and why.

i'll propose properties of the answer, not knowing it,
and i'll propose an answer for purposes of improving on it.

the properties are that of sr: comparable constraints, to establish a reliable subjective experience. until we have a measurable SELF and variation, i bet two people should simply share the

SELF that is CAKE.
in 250.

## ask and tell
1. comm non-atomic links with sayings - quotes.

a wants what b knows

lang coordinates.

naturally, all referents observable in the world.

it struggles at instances of the qualia problem.

### aware
when 
1-a does not have internal_state_1 (is1) and
2-b has is1,

what lets A know 
Q1- 2
Q2- b knows 1 and 2

what is style( B -> A )?
- reality-A =? reality-B
(as it currently reads, this question is *actually* how do we, C, know that... Q1 and Q2. better to reframe as A == I, writer, and B == you, reader; or similar)

### agency
B knows his own example of
PLAN, what changed 1 to 2.

can B's PLAN be
Q3-used by A?
Q4-explainable to A (given 1)?
and worthwhile (faster than A, otherwise)?

### communicable
what lets
- A and B trust B can provide PLAN for A to move from 1 to 2?

intuition says what 
expert needs to say to 
novices is
what to do.

contrast this with
for how long.

the raw measure of efficacy is as follows:

instr-recipe 
10m blitz conditions
1-emphasize ingredient and task list
2-emphasize quantity, size, duration of task, focus distribution

# claim
1-misleading shape-bias; "false cognates"
novice over fixates on what is distinct (shape bias).
expert only is aware that some distinct things are as easy as familiar,
whereas some almost-familiar shapes might be unusually difficult.
- false cognates.

2-misleading intersection
- false familiarity based on object and verb; combo is unfamiliar.
