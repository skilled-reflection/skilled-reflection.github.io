This book is centered on you, the specific reader that you are aware is currently reading. I am the one writing. SELF. For now, focus on applying these words to your actual SELF, and determining exactly what or who that is. PRI. Identify and own your PRIs before you die. PPL. You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are PPL. You will be too, but not yet. BET. First youll BET about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing. Education. At that point you should become a STUDENT of better methods. WORDs. As a STUDENT youll simulate methods efficiently with WORDs. Revision. You want an answer to the same questions (below) as the rest. [Revise][Revisions] your WORDs until they are uniquely you. COMM. Then you may contextualize and communicate who you are among PPL. Until then, you and I and they are all the same. 0.2 Questions You. How am I and what do I need? Self. What must I do to have it? Priorities. What actions maximize cake in my life? Others. What are people? Bet. How do I take action? Learn. How do I figure out a better plan for my life? Words. What are they good for? Revision. What would my life look like on paper? Communication. How do I relate to or help others? 0.3 Words A book with defined terms is a book for humans. Below are key terms and their definitions, to distinguish you and me. Links to those primary contexts follow each definition. Note that, because this list is statically generated, there will be slight discrepancies with definitions in main text as sections become updated. (Last revised: v2.15).

Thank you for your patience. I welcome any and all constructive feedback (skilledreflection@gmail.com). Check back later for a revised and updated version. 0.5 Version When I first set out to write SR as a book I quickly realized a problem could hang me up forever, both simple and superficial. It is the problem of framing CONTENT (STYLE), as basic as knowing what order to present the information, so as to maximally reveal the value. For illustration, this is at least the 15th unique thesis for a preface, and even as i write it I know i am woefully failing. Left unaddressed, the consequence is a poverty of readership and intellectual engagement, and the inevitable death of SR. In version one of this book, i deliberately set aside this problem, for the personally more desparate issue, of attempting to name and contain a system, at all. while i succeeded my decided priority, i failed the known order issue I must say, as i issue the 2nd version, the consequence of the problem, has crippled me. Version 2 takes the first step in remediation by streamlining all essential terms and links of the system into a shared frame, called the garden (introduced in version one, as concept, but not integrated in practice). Even still, in this respect version 2 is proto, at best. I pen this Foreward to the 2nd Version at the advent of having spelled out critical details, via example, of the problem, namely, spelling out my process of revising away STYLE from CONTENT. the spelling should show you in backward fashion why and how i write the way i do. I hope that for those who fell off the previous train, you find renewed interest to ride again.

You are going to die someday. This book is for you if there is something in the meantime worth maximizing. Please engage your life. This book is meant to help you understand and take action, starting right now. 1.2 Test Please get a pencil and note the date and TIME, right now: ____________. The WORDS in this book are meaningful only when you apply them to your life. If you wrote the date and time as requested in step 4, you have proven enough to yourself that you are open to trying new ideas. You are prepared to grow and continue reading. If you left the line blank, you might tell yourself you are open to new ideas. You will be right when you complete the task. Either write the TIME above or stop reading, and take a better action to improve your life, right now. 1.3 Game From now on, every WORD you (or I) say is a PLAN for action. That PLAN is meaningless until you take that action, whether GOOD or BAD. Therefore, spend less time worrying about why this WORD or that PLAN. Spend more time deciding which will be the next moves in your game of life. Sincerely, student0 1.4 Camp This book presents plain and obvious facts of life as the antidote to modern complexities of life. In most cases, the relevance can be seen more clearly if you simulate the experience being described, or explicitly consider it in your life (See Role of Reading). Lets practice. For example, consider going on a camping trip. Look at the clock and determine when you should expect to arrive. Whatever that time, when you arrive, you will likely be over- prepared, under-prepared, or 1-3 hours late. Or you might be an experienced camper. Either way, this is your only shot at a lifelong camping trip for yourself on Earth. My guess is you are very likely late to your own life. The games we (PPL, SCIENTISTs, etc.) play to explain away this fact, end with this book. 1.5 Pitch To understand this book will require you to find and repair the disconnect between your minds image of TIME, and the one you are physically bound to. If you fail, you will die in two worlds, the world you imagine you could have lived, and the one you did. You, however, would like to ace your own life. Part one of this book (The Garden) gives you all the general answers, and the basic tools for finding the answers particular to you. Part two teaches you how to (re)build your tools. 1.6 Eat The one thing up to you that this book will not do is draw the line between need and want. In this book, FOOD refers to needs and CAKE refers to wants. You must practice discerning which is which for you, until it is second-nature. Then, all decisions can be made as follows: If hungry, eat FOOD. If full, prepare and pack FOOD. If time, eat or prepare CAKE. Beware of thinking CAKE is FOOD. 1.7 Homeless Do, dont think. Likely at this point you have slipped into thinking this is a book discussing a philosophy, but it is not. FOOD vs CAKE is not understood and solved as a mental exercise in your living room, but by experiencing and paying attention. Whats more, if you dont have a living room, CAKE can be painfully obvious. Be homeless. 1.8 Food The odds are you arent homeless and will avoid becoming so. As with any hypothetical, practice finding the nearest analogous, personally meaningful experience: You couldnt find your car in the middle of winter. You went camping without waterproof gear and it rained. For weeks your shower only produced ice cold water. You were isolated in your house for most of two years during a global pandemic. Whatever the circumstance, your HABIT protests for a change in PLANS. However small or profound the suffering or its threat: There is initially terror, frustration and suffering. Enduring, suffering will change. You will need far less FOOD than you thought, giving more time and quality CAKE you really desire. 1.9 Plan In the first half of this book is a conceptual metaphor described as a Garden. It is a mental model of reality, designed to bring clarity. Your Garden is your GOALS put on key IDEAS of this book. You need the Garden to combat the idealistic side of your mind, inclined to ignore TIME and your SELF, which sets you up for failure and suffering. The second half of these chapters elaborates explicitly on the key IDEAs. 1.10 LESSONs At the end of the book are a series of LESSONs for identifying what matters, whats wrong, and whats next in your life. They are designed to be useful at any time, and especially repeatedly. Dont wait to finish the book to try one out, because they are pivotal to Skilled Reflection. However, dont do too many of them before at least reading the relevant section that explains the format of [Skilled Reflection][Skilled Reflection]. 1.11 Definitions WORDS in all capital letters are IDEAS that have specific definitions that differ slightly from conventional use. For example, WORK is an IDEA referring to careers, but not yard WORK. Do not overlook the nuances for these terms, they are the result of careful decisions about the FOOD and CAKE of the IDEAs. You can find a list of the key ideas in the [Index of Definitions][Index of Definitions]. &lt;- Use the enumeration of ideas to cross-reference. The item immediately above is c1.49. c1 referring to the chapter Introduction, and 49 to the numbered IDEA. This system will be taken advantage of in future revisions. Each chapter deals with a distinct perspective or dimension of life and the GOALs related to it. What is said is what can be simplified for generalizable guidance. Like FOOD vs CAKE, the HABITs relevant to your GOALs can be closer to FOOD, or excessive like CAKE. In the context of definitions, they will be referred to instead, as good and bad (For example, [c9.60][PRIs Differ]). "],["the-garden.html", "The Garden", " The Garden "],["self.html", "Chapter 2 Self 2.1 Garden 2.2 Today 2.3 Goal 2.4 Plan 2.5 SELF 2.6 Home", " Chapter 2 Self 2.1 Garden Imagine your life takes place in a garden. Visualizing your life as a garden allows you to ground actions and PLANS. The mind analyzes well with visual space. In this garden well consider all your biological needs  eating, sleeping especially  as literal. Your plants are GOALS, and gardening is your PLAN. FOOD and CAKE exists in the form of fruit from plants. Whatever it takes to obtain your CAKE you can consider as an act of gardening. Every one of your life ambitions, GOALS, is buried in the ground as seeds. Finding a life partner, acquiring a car or promotion, or resolving a conflict with your childhood friend are all matters spread across the dirt in need of water, sunlight, andmost importantyour TIME. Other GOALS, like your favorite hobbies, or TV shows, take little WORK and grow almost anywhere. Whether they are dear to you or weeds, if they take your TIME, they are PLANTS in your garden. Except that they start as seeds. And what do you do with seeds to make plants? You garden, dear human, you garden. All actions toward a plant are according to PLAN. All actions toward your SELF are to be considered literal in the garden metaphor. For example, if you need to eat, or go to the bathroom, you physically go to the place and literally do the deed. (There will be no pooping on plants, or a pooping plant in this garden.) Thus, in the garden you are still a normal human bound to a normal space and time, capable of: acting according to bodily need, moving about space, and gardening. 2.2 Today Today, you are looking out across the entire garden. What has already been planted? What will you add and how much TIME will you devote to those GOALS? Every seed you plant  even an abstract one like passing a course or making a friend implies things in and out of your control like WORK and weather, or beyond your awareness, like what your boss loses sleep over. Meditate on the final products of your garden. Is there a more important plant that deserves your TIME today? Meditate on the priorities of your WORK. Do two plants grow better when together? Make a quick and accurate assessment, but dont sit here all morning thinking about it. A garden is for working in, to get the FOOD and CAKE you need. What do you need to cultivate, today? What do you want to cultivate in this life? First, you want what your body and mind best respond to. Many of these seeds will be obvious. It is up to you how curious you are for what better life is possible. The day is too short to try everything, and many things are not worth trying. There is not always harm to planting something that does not grow, but sometimes there is. You could run out of space, TIME, or energy that could have been devoted to better crops; You might get a weak yield for trying to grow something not suitable in your climate, or find you have no taste or stomach for the fruit. In the garden, the COSTS of GOALS are grounded in their most basic sense: TIME and attention. 2.3 Goal The following are core concepts for application beyond the Garden. A GOAL names an ideal future reality, comprises a PLAN to increase its likelihood, associated with CHUD. These three things encompass all cognitive activity related to reality. Call anything that could be true, but isnt right now, a GOAL, and any effort in support of making it true a PLAN. It is your GOAL if you aim to increase its probability of being true. A GOAL can be finite or persistent, singular or recurring, or realistic or not. 2.4 Plan If you will need to do something before it is in your hand, it requires a PLAN. A PLAN is any combination of WORDS where the writing or reading of them aims to improve the chance or decrease the COST of achieving your GOAL. Most PLANS are instructions (INSTR) for learning, making, changing, reminding. 45.1. Product INSTR are a PLAN to maximize satisfaction and minimize liability. 45.2. For example, lamp INSTR will likely suggest not to put it in water. A DOC is a PLAN for GOALS to complete a linguistic product 46.1. Example DOCs include a resume or epitaph on a tombstone. LESSONS are a PLAN template for thinking. 47.1. Read and complete LESSON steps in order. TOOLS are physical or mental objects that help you accomplish your GOAL. What is materially requiredmuscle energy, cash, brain poweris COST. All COSTS can be reduced to TIME. COST is any action that has a direct exchange. COSTS often are secondary objectives within a PLAN. For example, you might buy a TOOL (COST). 2.5 SELF Every day, as a human, you spend TIME and attention just meeting basic needs: eating, drinking, pooping, and sleeping. These actions are subgoals of maintaining SELF, the category of basic human GOALS. FOOD is the necessary and sufficient material to satisfy these needs. CAKE is anything (else) fulfilling, that you are inclined to pursue, including the reason for living. The GOALS of SELF are whats necessary and sufficient to obtain and manage FOOD and maximize BET outcomes (c5.28). Separate FOOD from CAKE. Be careful not to mislabel CAKE as FOOD. CAKE may appear sufficient but ask yourself if it is necessary. Build routines for health and fitness, physical safety (shelter), a sound mind, healthy relationships. Master the SELF (survive well). 2.6 Home HOME is the collection of materials and TOOLS needed for SELF. Within a HOME related actions are grouped into rooms. For example, a kitchen, is for eating, storing, preparing and disposing of FOOD. HOME also includes all physical material and resources you own, including MONEY, and environment and basis for HABITS. A good HOME is clean and ALIGNED for FOOD. A bad HOME facilitates bad HABITS and takes more TIME to maintain. All your life can be very well characterized by a series of purely numerical data: Event timestamps associated with a location. The average movement over time, consider as HABITS. The average location is HOME. "],["priorities.html", "Chapter 3 Priorities 3.1 Calling 3.2 Cakes 3.3 Death 3.4 Sick 3.5 Attention 3.6 Now", " Chapter 3 Priorities 3.1 Calling Your callingyour highest priorityis yours to name. If you overcome your DOUBTs and see reality plainly, you will want peace. But we all have DOUBTs, so you want some form of dignity and affirmation. Tell me your calling, student, and subtracting from peace, Ill tell you your DOUBTs. On mastering my book your life will be regimented to afford your calling. 3.2 Cakes In your garden you have the seeds and sprouts of the best you could want, and the most important of what you need. There are two important things to keep in mind, however clear things may seem right now. The first is to always leave room for your goals to change, if and when you achieve them. Think of what you can grow from the seeds of the best apple in your crop. The second is that much of what you could achieve, you wont, before the day is over, nor before you die. Before there was a garden, you lived as if you wouldnt die. At least some of your GOALs assume tomorrow is a good time to start. I did, at least. The list of my GOALS grew like a wild vine and I found myself overwhelmed by what else I wanted, and yet an inability to equalize various goals. The very difficult task of your priorities, at their core, is to establish the optimal intersection of finite time and infinite, ever-changing desire. For example, sleep. About 4 hours daily is a vital priority for everyone (FOOD), but sleeping in on the weekends is usually not (CAKE). In your garden, you are limited in what you can do in one day, and in one lifetime. Even if you build machines to work fields that stretch out to the horizons, you can only eat so much in a day and a lifetime. How do you most want to spend your time? If your GOAL is to obtain something you do not yet have and have never tasted, be careful. It may not satisfy you how you imagine. Suppose your goal takes 300 hours of labor. You might spend 10 years accruing the time on task, or immerse yourself and achieve your GOAL in under 1 year. Any true GOAL has a specific optimal deadline. Today, you grow the best apple you can, yet having tasted it, you might discover a more refined GOAL is closer to your heart. Whether this apple is FOOD or CAKE, the more you align with yourself, the more you will see your GOALS differently than you first conceived of them. Leave time in your life to achieve the next GOAL. 3.3 Death Many PPL believe in seeds with special powers, like true love, or winning the lottery. One seed grows the duration of your life, which you rarely notice but are often aware of. When you eat it, the sun sets for the last TIME and you bite the dust. It happens to all of us. Think about this, but dont dwell on it. 3.4 Sick Maybe you are sick, down or depressed. Then today, do not look out onto your field as a day to WORK. Today your field gives to you, and you should take what you need. This is what it is for. Do not beat yourself up for what you cannot give today. This assumes your field is only meaningful for its future. And before youre well again, remember this moment well, so you may prevent the urge to be disappointed the next TIME you are less than productive. If you must WORK to feel worthwhile, WORK to budget for a fact of being human: you are always sometimes less than productive, and occasionally your setbacks come in unfortunate forms, at inconvenient times. 3.5 Attention Think of whats happening in your garden this very moment: nothing, while youre sitting here thinking. Reflect only enough to improve your actions. PRI is the optimizing and managing of all your GOALS. All GOALS rely on a single, limited source of attention, and existence: you. Attention. At its best, this limiting fact drastically improves the reality of PLANS and GOALS. At its worst, it is the most common oversight responsible for bloated CHUD. GOAL importance partly depends on context (c3.6). Group your GOALS by shared actions, places, or times. Make/group/keep, order, reduce in the order (pictured below). A place for everything, everything in its place ALIGN SELF and CAKE. Ask what it would take to change (if possible), and whether change is worth it. Savings occur anytime you complete an action that serves various GOALS. An example is Grouping (c3.35.4). Apply to IDEAs, PLANs, GOALs, or HOME things. TIME is the constant (or denominator) for FORCES, FORGETTING, PRI, and LIB. Do not ignore TIME. Estimate durations accurately for GOAL accomplishment. Study TIME to learn reality, SELF, and their LINK. Continually assess whether GOAL benefits outweighs costs of TIME. Maybe it seems unnecessary to represent WORK satisfaction and relationship quality in terms of carrots and tomatoes. When you get bored, ask yourself why attempting to understand and define yourself bores you. What is happening in your life, and what is in your control if these are unclear? If you are not reflecting on your life, your garden is a foggy labyrinth, and you are a drunk gardener wearing oven-mitts. You are pushed like a sail by any wind, the FORCES of reality. A FORCE is any cause of change. A FORCE underlies every action involved in a GOAL, yours or otherwise. There are forces within your control, and forces outside. MAINTENANCE is the COST of FORCE to neither move toward nor away from a GOAL. ALIGNMENT is when NORM or natural FORCE causes your GOAL to be more likely. To ALIGN is to adjust your GOAL to be more like another force, usually one acting against your GOAL. Study how forces WORK against you. moment 3.6 Now Now is the only use-case of shared space, in time. A MOMENT is any now that is not the latest, either future or past. A record of now becomes past nows of variable use-case. That is, we might reflect on the previous nows that we shared. Note that past nows do not maintain the same level of rigor. They are degraded to hype when mis-replayed, misunderstood, or accessed under changed priorities. In seeing passage, we might speculate on future nows to be shared. The discourse of past or future is always at least partially hype, but real (use) when bet on. "],["ppl.html", "Chapter 4 PPL 4.1 Places 4.2 Gate 4.3 Work 4.4 Analysis 4.5 Others", " Chapter 4 PPL Just like you, others are trying to figure out what goes on in their own garden.* PPL are different VERSIONs of each others PRI ([see also c9.70][NORMs STYLE]). Amid the goals and forces of this chapter, none of what is described includes using WORDs. Reader, you will begin to understand their nature in the next chapter, BET, but as it pertains WORDs that PPL use with each other, not until the last chapter, COMM. 4.1 Places Consider PPL in terms of the four places of your life: on your garden dealing with your SELF. on someone elses garden. at WORK making something for others for money. getting something someone else made (MARKET). Sometimes you are at your gardens edge looking elsewhere. For example, when you read an email or social media feed, as if looking across your neighbors plot, studying how to bring your lettuce back to life, or celebrating your friends successful pumpkin patch. 4.2 Gate Despite garden-based PRIs, most of your time is spent outside your garden, and mostly for WORK (about 80,000 hours in your life). Acknowledge the PPL in your PRIs, yet dont let them distract. Notice how long you leave your garden and to where. Spend only as much time needed away for your PRIs. For example, most time on others gardens, and any more than the minimum at WORK or MARKET is CAKE. When in doubt, go HOME and stare at your plants. At least that CAKE is free. 4.3 Work Where do you get seeds for FOOD from and how did you know to plant them? From other PPL, right? No silly, you dont know how to garden a sandwich! Lucky for you, many of the most important crops you want are already grown, prepared and handed to youin exchange for money. Money is traded for maintenance of, or insurance for SELF and CAKE, like apples, miracle medical procedures, and a toilet to take your poop somewhere else. WORK is performing a specific task on a collective garden, like an institutions in exchange for money. It is a pre-arranged visit to another garden for a specified time. Whether or not you like it, or it directly fulfills garden needs, WORK is made to serve NORMS, not you. NORMS are all actions assumed of (or about) the average person. They are the web of FORCES of all actions of all PPL, including WORK, religion, popular attitudes, and DOUBTS. 4.4 Analysis If you have a job that pays you to think, your mind is hired to make NORMS products real. Instead of your reality, your WORK is to translate NORMSs reality, CHUD-adjusted. NORMS assume you will WORK for money for goods. Language, agreed usage of WORDS, is made from NORMS. NORMS push against individuality (except where it provides a lucrative job opportunity). Relationships (RLTP) are GOALS about PPL (PPL). Good ones are aligned with your GOALS. Bad ones COST more. A RLTP is a reciprocal pair of BETS, yours of them, and vice versa. One is the better and the other is the bet and bet on. RLTPS, especially family members, coordinate many GOALS for SAVINGS. 4.5 Others Maybe they are your friend, and need help with some unruly vines, or maybe you just like their apples. Sometimes, PPL will contribute to your goals, as if bringing water to crops you didnt recognize need them. 4. Sometimes PPL will try to water your crops when they dont need watering. Sometimes youll return with higher morale or a bag of apples. Sometimes youll need to water some crops that need to be watered, because the sight of their neglect cannot be ignored. The challenges that overwhelm you are the same for others, just not always the same amount nor at the same time. The place, duration and impact on your PRIs are the basic measurements of a RLTP. Pick WORK and RLTPs, including friends, that maximize your other PRIS including possibly one that maximizes TIME and money to apply to other PRIS. Maximally ALIGN with NORMS with least compromise to PRIs. Get along with PPL. PPL are the part of PRIs that require the most care, and fewest words. A GOOD RLTP is a CONTRACT of the reciprocated actions (USE) between two PPL. A BAD RLTP is HYPED mutual BETs (unaligned with actions), that waste time.

You can take control of your life, or you can let the world BET for you. You can commit yourself to finding out which thoughts are right or leave it to chance to have better life. A commitment is the first step, but far from the last. If you want your dreams to become real, listen to your DOUBTs. Then test them. Winning means your reality is one step toward your GOAL. Losing is the wake-up call to be more realistic. Betting is a protocol to guide you to reality, and, if youre lucky, your dreams might fit in. How real will your dreams get before you die? 5.1 Stranger A stranger comes to your garden at the end of a long day, which you realize only when you hear him chopping his jaw at you. You look up. No really, consider it, right now. Imagine the most realistic, attainable, best life you could have. Imagine taking the first step and then stay with the thought. Listen to the fear that surfaces. For the moment, never mind how the world has gotten in your way. How are you in your own way? He seems to be in your way. Hes staring past your wet forehead. See your DOUBTs with curiosity. Now BET on what you tell yourself you believe. BET on overcoming them. But you mostly only think of frustration and say, I appreciate the suggestion. Lets both BET. Name what you believe you can accomplish tomorrow, in terms of what you think holds you back most. If you make it happen before sun-up, youll be over the most daunting hurdle between you and your outcome. And Ill give you the equivalent of your harvest, today. If you fail, you leave me todays harvest. Okay, you say. Youll show him. The rocks on the far field. Theyre on a slippery slope. To build the home I want, I need those rocks, but Im afraid of falling. Ive collected every rock on my land and I need those rocks. Tomorrow Ill finish my foundation with rocks from the slippery slope. The stranger and you have set up a bet, a type of belief. 5.2 BET A BET is a PLAN template for reconciling REALITY with CHUD, to accomplish GOALS. Betting is confronting COSTs, HABITs, UNKNOWNs and DOUBTs that stand in the way of your wants and dreams. The TIME that passes and the status of your GOAL when it runs out are an intersection of reality: the world and you. To name them, is to shed CHUD. Every IDEA you hold is a BET with a rolling deadline, idiosyncratic successes, and revisions. BET wins shorten your PLAN, and the distance to your GOAL. Losses should guide revisions to your CHUD. To BET, name: a step in your PLAN, a deadline to achieve it, and the C.H.U.D. for that duration. Blitz to revise and win, and log your actions. When the deadline arrives, take stock. Compare your action log to your PLAN. Identify CHUD factors that best explain discrepancies. Revise PLAN, updated with CHUD factor predictions. (Record TIME to do the next BET or GOAL, Revise, etc.) Start the next BET or GOAL. 5.3 After The next morning you woke to a field in disarray and a letter. You had worked harder than you planned, and still fell short of your GOAL. If you did more than you would have without the BET, you won something, including evidence that there is some commitment in you to make your dreams come true. The biggest reward is not positive: accept you failed, and partly due to a miscalculation. Therefore, likely other parts of your PLAN are misguided, and your GOAL is further than you estimate. If you disagree, lets BET again. First, take a minute to learn from your planning mistake. 5.4 C.H.U.D. Even if you make a PLAN and BET on it, you can fail. Why dont we achieve our GOALS? Here are the four critical aspects of success, and, by extension, clues for why we fail. CHUD encompasses the changes in you, the world, and your GOAL for you to achieve it. 5.5 COST COSTs (c2.51) and HABITs are knowable facts. Observers could independently note and agree on your COSTS and HABITS. COSTS are the unadjusted record of transactions in your life. Referring to COST is referring to typical transactions for a GOAL. For example, a relationship with an alcoholic poses a RISK of violence. 5.6 HABIT The unadjusted, plain record of everything you have physically done, is your HABIT. Referring to HABIT is referring to patterns of behavior. For example, I eat every morning before 9 AM. HABITS are your most likely and reliable FOOD or CAKE actions. Bad HABITS are FORCES working against your GOALS. Good HABITS are ALIGNED with GOALS. 5.7 UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS and DOUBTS are the gap between your real and perceived COSTs and HABITs. If you have not arrived at the GOAL, there are UNKNOWNs. UNKNOWNs are all that are fully out of your control (analogous to statistical error). For example, a train might stop you from arriving on TIME. UNKNOWNs are reduced by estimating causes of failure. For example: I will die, but not know how or when. The cause is UNKNOWN. I will die due to a natural disaster or cancer. The cause is named, and the UNKNOWN is pushed to those things underlying causes. 5.8 DOUBT DOUBTs are misperceptions caused or perpetuated by your HABIT. Like COSTs, DOUBTs are the patterns of UNKNOWN. DOUBT is any systematic error that is possible to be addressed by another human of equal ability and resources. For example, self-fulfilled prophesies, irrational fear or anxiety. Good DOUBTS temper an optimistic PLAN. Otherwise (Bad) DOUBTS: fuel bad HABITs and fantasies. Like Fear, anxiety, and jealousy, reflect overestimations. Like narrow-mindedness, reflect underestimations. Like distraction and boredom can be: anxiety about your future. discomfort toward present reality. distrust in your past. Most of these issues, if deep enough, require therapy.

No one chose to be born. Everyone begins life with their own unnamed and unanswered problems. Books are an authors answers; they can only tell a student what the answer is not (quite). Instead of teaching how to read between the lines, let the student define the problem through their reality and life GOALS. Let them write the PLAN and teach them only what is needed to succeed. Imagine a perfect course exists, designed to teach you to fulfill your specific ambitions. Every aspect of what you NEED to know, that is known and communicable, is the only thing written. Everything that cannot be known but must be discovered or practiced, is laid out as a set of instructions, described in the WORDS that maximize the learning opportunity, and your progress. Rather than a course in a classroom, the perfect class is a manual to reference as you live your life, or at least until youve internalized its contents: when to take a break to strategize your decisions, lessons on what opportunities to watch for and resist, and so on. Any social role you wish to take on, artist, engineer, therapist, insurance salesperson, reliable partner, is customized intimately, curated perfectly for what you need. Any RLTP or interpersonal skill that is realistically possible for you is preceded with the guidance and education that prepares you emotionally to choose the right experiences that set you up to be most likely to find and make the most of opportunities to share yourself with another. 6.2 Prompt Is there a better version of you? Are you capable of moving toward it? Are you ready? If your answers are yes, then you are a student. To live a better life, you will commit to change your actions. First, you will learn what changes are needed. 6.3 Admissions This is a boot camp whose purpose is to train adults to think harder, clearer and more effectively. to produce intelligent solutions for personal and social puzzles. to have a higher cognitive discipline. to instill shared CAKE about reason, thinking and discourse. to empower. It is a training program designed to break down bad habits of thought, and build good ones while immersed here, a culture of rational thinking isolated from the outside world. 6.4 Challenge Here you will relentlessly confront your ideas about the world, with instructors drilling intellectual skills (writing essays, arguing for ideas, and developing proposals for action). You will be trained to move toward your GOALS with focus, even in the face of perceptual, physical, or emotional distractions. Over TIME, students could expect to cultivate a sharper focus on cognitive objectives, resilience to distractions and challenges. If you graduate, it will be with the ability to identify, develop, and communicate ideal critical, rational arguments, positions or PLANS (orally or written) given the available knowledge, finite TIME, and resources at hand (reference material, teamwork). you will also learn a code of behavior for being a community leader, collaborating or competing with an irrational world. The central requirement for applicants will be a commitment to better understand the SELF and world. 6.5 Student Students are PPL with IDEAS from EXPERIENCE toward selfish GOALS. Lessons depend on students prior knowledge. A STUDENT has a GOAL that can be better named and planned. requires TIME away from BETTING. admits not knowing but capable. Students learn to represent their knowledge in WORDS; to prefer better, alternative WORDS. A student sees the impersonal as more reliable both for selfish GOALS and social ones. A bad student studies to avoid action, or for its own sake. A Student WRITES IDEAs and GOALS to their INSTRUCTOR. Your GOAL is clear. You want: The strength needed to take the right steps and make a habit of it, keen eyes to estimate the destination and correct course, and a focused mind to steady the foot. 6.6 Consent This is an in-person immersive experience. You only really learn what you need to know to be who you really want. You wont learn unless you cannot escape needing it; in a dedicated environment that fosters acquisition, minimizes interference. Whether youre here for the 7- or 30-day experience, you will WORK hard every minute. For every minute of lesson on my TIME, students are to provide two minutes of writing, either toward others learning or in direct application toward their GOAL. 6.7 Course Dedicate to identity growth. Be: Quiet, except when tasks require verbal response. Receptive to WORK and feedback provided by the instructor. Committed to producing genuinely inspired ideas, working quickly, and seeking improvement. Respectful that all are equal in voice, and aim to describe solutions with collective CAKE. Receptive and responsive to prompts and observations (from peers and/or instructors) especially CHUD, vague language, and cognitive bias. Motivated to describe solutions that benefit others, when possible, including peer-review. Learn: Precisely and only what is needed to trust a clear picture of what your life is. First, how to make a PLAN, a map of who you are, and who you want to be; Repeat Part one of this book, until your PLAN is good enough to be wrong, and truthful enough to hurt. This will be the beginning of change, and the first test of your commitment. Your performance is evaluated simply: whether or not you end up eating, sleeping, thinking, talking, and acting differently. 6.8 Think Think, student. Do not take notes, simply pay attention. Everything I say is meant plainly. If you get confused, forget it, and pay attention to right now. Our GOAL here is thinking. Thinking happens in your heads. Right now your job is to think about the truth you see in what i say. A student has two roles to think in: Reader and Writer. 6.9 READ Read, student. A reader is a listener and observer. Reading is the same as listening to an instructor, except that the speaking pace doesnt determine how fast you have to think, or remind you to pay attention! Your attention cannot be trusted on its own, so lose distractions like your smart phone. You will befriend the simplest scientific instrument, a clock. The clock is a cue to think. When it goes off, get back on task. The clock will babysit your unreliable attention. 6.10 Truth Your GOAL in reading is to isolate the truth from the lie. Try reading this sentence: Everyone is best off running weekly until they die. Youre thinking, this cant be true for everyone, so its a lie. Not so fast. There are many components to this idea, and likely many that you believe are truthful. Often a lie becomes true just by changing the pronouns in the text. Consider this revision: I am best off running weekly until I die. Perhaps now the WORDS are more truthful to you. Doing this makes a clear relationship between your belief and the authors. Becoming smart is the discipline of understanding how you relate to others. When reading, dismiss only what you fully believe is an intentional lie. More generally, read to assess your BET on the WORDS reflecting TRUTH. Whether to a single WORD, a line, chapter, or book. Assign WEIGHTs (0 to 9) to what you read, to complete this prompt: I BET this is true for: 0 = not even the author. 1 = only the author. 2 = the author, me, and a few others. 3 = Us and 30% of everyone else. 9 = Us and about 90% of everyone else. For every assertion and assumption you read, begin assuming it is a 9, working backwards according to evidence you hold. 6.11 Lesson The following mini lesson illustrates the risk at handinvoluntary comprehension, and the benefit at stake from deliberate reading. Consider the following quote, Change your thoughts to change your life. Comprehension is involuntary. You cannot help but recognize meaning when you read. This means that you likely thought the quote was largely unrealistic. Reading as proposed here, is strongly voluntary. For example, reread the quote, this TIME assuming it is reasonable, serious, and valuable. The statement is the core assumption to this book, and any psychological theory. For example, Freuds talk therapy was, in his TIME, the radical idea that WORDS could fix PPL. Therefore, do not waste the opportunity to consider a truth that could change your life by failing to entertain a simple assumption. 6.12 Say How will your life look if you put it on paper? Like a bunch of WORDS. How do you change it? By deleting the WORDS with lies, and replacing them with better WORDS. The right WORDS will change your actions and your life. To live a better life, starts with your WORDS. In order to do something about thoughts, we need to think on paper. [Youll write a lot. Youll delete a lot. Youll get good at writing.] 6.13 WRITE BET on WORDS. A writer invests TIME and energy to map feelings onto WORDS. Good writing is discovering, curating, and applying insight. Bad WRITING has an author; ad hominem. Revisions also make you a WRITER. When you revise WORDS (yours or others) to maximize your BET, you are a writer. Separate thought and SELF (author), by BETTING explicitly. State your assumptions, do not justify them. -is-STYLE-bad Replace I am. with tag WORDS. Strive for COMM-CONTENT and brevity; Write only valuable BETs, or WORDS that manifest valuable BETs. Prioritize understanding over original writing. WRITING for LIB-PPL, relatable, depersonalized, objective WORDS, minimizes rot, maximizes PLAN utility. 6.14 Instructor I am an instructor, a guardian of true IDEAs and WRITER of a general PLAN (this book). An instructor READS, and enforces BETs on LINKs toward a PLAN. My GOALS are to Minimize student effort and TIME to write. READ for cognitive biases, illogical appeals, and imprecise language, and WRITE feedback that is dispassionate and neutral, yet invested and True. Reward arguments based on (Truth:) REALITY, SELF, and CAKE. Reward IDEAS shared (vs kept). 6.15 Answers Which lines from this book would you [BET on][How to Read], written as-is, or revised for you? Assign 100 dollars (total) to those lines according to their relative impact, and you are an IBC student; an author of shared truth. Suppose a representative set of PPL did the same thing. Heres a game to help imagine. Each students bets go to a general pool. When bets on a line reach a critical mass, the pool of sub-par bets is split among winners. Cash is divided. Also, points are recorded, to incentivize a deeper purpose: A game, where the prize is the collective revision and authorship of this book. After x wins, your name appears on the title. High scores are on the acknowledgements page. This is the process and meaning of READER and WRITER; bound directly to material and action, IRL.

This chapter is about problems and answers regarding the ACT of describing, itself: WORDS said do not usually reflect what PPL want or need. By engaging the gap between WORDS and reality, you increase SELF-awareness (BET). Better WORDS mean more practical understanding and expectations, more complete desires, and The capacity to make a concrete PLAN for achieving your GOALS. This will include healthier COMM and RLTPs. A community with better WORDS has clearer idea sharing, synthesizing, developing, teaching and learning. 7.2 Problem Speaking your mind is difficult to do accurately. A memory system dealing with language is tasked to translate thoughts into the right WORDS from tens of thousands. It is prone to inaccuracies. Similarly, a listener focused on comprehending, is not likely to monitor all the incidental priming effects of WORDS on a memory system. WORDS said and heard impact both parties beliefs and behaviors. Saying WORDs or Hearing and understanding a WORD is a very small physical action, to describe real actions and consequences. The issue is that WORDs can be more and less right, more and less helpful, and without intervention, it is very difficult to know how much this is true in any example of WORD USE. Bad WORDS keep CHUD expensive and waste TIME. The COST of an individual WORD is tiny, but we say tens of thousands per day (Levelt). 7.3 Bet A GOOD general BET about WORDs is to begin assuming every WORD is a BET on hypotheticals, which can be true (reality) or false (fantasy). A PLAN is a BET on a winning arrangement of WORDS that result in the GOAL. Reading, thinking, saying, and writing a WORD perpetuates that WORDs IDEA over others, either moving you toward a GOAL, or your HABIT. 7.4 Simulation WORDS efficiently simulate possible worlds. You can think through far more situations with WORDS, than you can (or should) act out. Your GOALS can be described in WORDS, and WORDS can be easily crossed out and revised. Good WORDS maximize productivity of thought, move you beyond pitfalls of CHUD, direct attention to PRIS, and predict reality; improve decisions and make you smarter. By thinking about all WORDS you experience (LIB), you can take control to limit your WORD use toward more productive ones, improving READ and WRITE decisions, increasing focus and TIME for GOALS. SIM (F-ACT) is the act of iterating between WRITE and READ, to evoke and NAME the optimal, held BET. Tour SIM is not constrained by IRL, but your picture of IRL, and your SIM GOAL is to capture the picture true to your CHUD estimate. 7.5 It It caused you to NAME in the first place. This cause is IT. GOOD-REF is giving the best NAME for our desired COMM. For example, take these background facts, which contains the basis of our desired REF. I woke at 8:30AM I wanted to sleep until 9:30AM. In my 9:00AM appointment with you, as you are talking, I yawn. You say, I must be boring you. I want to hear what you were going to say (COMM-PRI). Each of these (below) are slightly different REFs based on the facts (above), ranked by GOOD-REF: Youre not, please continue. No, Im tired. No, I woke early. Dont make assumptions. Im not. I woke at 8:30AM, but wanted to sleep until 9:30AM, so I think I yawned because I am tired. I yawned because I am tired. I can see why you thought I was bored, and Im sorry. [Nothing] All of the REFs above combined suggest the IT you want to convey. A GOOD-REF is the one that uses truth to focus and advance the COMM-PRI. Below are the REF attributes that make each choice unique (and less GOOD). Give a simple reason to return to the COMM-PRI (example 1 above). Does not add to COMM-PRI nor return to it. 3-early may not be true. Focus on others mistake and issue a command. Begs the question. Focus on the distraction. Focus on the distraction and makes the same kind of REF which the other did and which caused the confusion. This can be anywhere in the list including 1, depending on what you DO or SAY next. 1: you or the other return to COMM-PRI without ever returning to this interruption. 4: it reduces the number of words said before returning to COMM-PRI. 8: the distraction is remembered, and mentioned again, later. Let this characterize the problem and approach, and I will end with a few primary objectives, besides. GOOD-REF is a plain IDEA or LINK. If GOOD-REF, the IDEA, crosses your mind while considering what to say, likely that it is a LINK. DECIDE and SAY REF within a few seconds, rather than THINKING more, unless the BET is obvious and worthwhile. BEST-REF is possible, but requires extra THINKING to know the valuable cause. This is not practical, so we go for conservative GOOD-REF. In USE, this means quickly NAME the relevant LINKs, and estimate the central or critical LINK between them. In our example of the facts, above, 1 is not obvious and adds little to 3. 5 is the COMM-PRI, and 4 is the cause, but not IT in what you say. 2 and 3 are IT, and specifically, the LINK between them. Unless you are a RECRUIT, to go any further will usually not be worth the COST. To go further is to specify what kind of link is between the two. WANT is HYPE, etc. GOOD-REF is NEW vs GIVEN. 7.6 Write-Plan Speak, write, initiate or respond only in limited duration and WORDS dictated by intended outcome. Use WORDS empirically, with a comparison group (vs) and quantity in mind. Ideas are more important than authorship. Do not use a WORD that is more of a Lie. Say the truth or be quiet. Use WORDS for decisions, not emotions. Use WORDS to facilitate PRIS. Do not write PLANS you wont follow. Stop talking when action (or listening) is needed. 7.7 Read-Plan Listen / read when you need to learn / connect. Limit duration/WORDS needed to assess consent. Distrust ego, and take nothing personally Investigate the empirical CAKE of WORDS. Revise to believe, and revise PLANS into ones youd follow. Remove / ignore style. Assert boundaries against exaggerated WORDS or unreliable ones. 7.8 Types A description of the kinds of simulation a word can make, and the kinds to prioritize. 7.9 EXAMPLE An EXAMPLE is an individual, particular event or object, of reality. An example with consequence is a USE-CASE. An example in-principle is a HYPE (hypothetical/hype). In COMM, EXAMPLES are described per the criteria that might support a USE of an EXAMPLE. WORDS are one of two types: LINKS: WORDS that give relationship between EXAMPLES, IDEAS, describe ACTIONS, ROLES, and transformations. IDEAS: WORDS that refer to EXAMPLES. An IDEA is a set of criteria that LINK EXAMPLES as similar (vs not). The most basic IDEA classifies EXAMPLES as A or not-A. blue is an IDEA that certain colored things are BLUE (A), and all other colors are not BLUE. Good IDEAS group EXAMPLES in a way that directs attention toward PLANS and GOALS. Bad IDEAS distract. The right LINK between ideas is the foundation of every thought, RECIPE or terrible calculation. 7.10 HYPE HYPE vs USE-CASE guides what and if to write. A GOAL is a named HYPE. GOOD HYPE are worthwhile GOALs, sub-GOALs, or ALT PLAN ACTIONs to consider. Dont WRITE HYPE without a BET. As all words should be toward PRIs, there are three general modes of PRI WORDs: h0 = history. HABIT is to history as action is to DOC. GOOD history is structured data of your HABIT, expressly for the purpose of revising future actions. h1 = plan (pri.txt, proj_doc.txt) h2 = doubt especially for bet. 7.11 Alternatives ALTs are any IDEA which measurably deviates a PLAN, and are defined directly with respect to the target IDEA. For example, BAD is an ALT to GOOD, as in GOOD-vs-BAD. Any other valid modes, if at all, are in support of maximal revision in these primary ones. A PLAN comprises: 1.the decided action 2.the best bet on it 3.alternative actions 4.the goal 5.the relevant CHUD GOOD GOALs and their PLANs are supported by USEs from your own history (SELF-H), and next best is NORM or OTHERS USE or DATA that generalizes. For example, a plan for a similar goal has previously succeeded. 7.12 Letters Mnemonics are memory aids. Reducing a word to a letter increases cognitive efficiency, as long as that letter stands for an idea you will frequently encounter. These letters illustrate kinds of word usage (not exhaustive): f define; function i synonym, sense, i.e., as in, e example, data-point, untested data h history (implied h0) h1 claim, thesis. vs h0 or h2. x Cross-references, xref d Data or evidence, summary v version / revise vs an alternative, sibling of a shared parent category. 7.13 NOTES Good NOTES clarify PRI (CONTENT) within BETS from secondary ones. In a DOC, PAR is a GROUPED set of WORDs roughly equivalent to a complex sentence. It has a primary subject and predicate, and includes any immediately relevant branches from either. In practice it is between 1 and 4 clauses. GOOD PAR successfully denotes a LINK between two IDEAs, with the following FORM: a syntactic tree, where [newline] is the right path in a fork, first indent ( -) is the left path in a fork, trailing- denotes all subsequent lines in section are equal childs. subsequent newline indents or in-line  are siblings left to right are siblings double linebreak ends the local tree. When word order is a left-to-right walk of a right-branching syntactic tree, sentence can be written in lines of random lengths, and read equally as unambiguously. Restrict reference and vocabulary to Simple- or Plain- English to reduce amibiguity. 7.14 Transparent Make folder and file names i-goals as transparent as possible imply or reveal its (hidden) members. Promote or consolidate high frequency items or only-childs. For example: ppl-work -\\&gt; work - self-home -\\&gt; home When creating or reusing a word for new applications, this principle should be a factor. 7.15 RECIPE A Recipe is one of the best ways to arrange PLANS. Lessons and instructions use a RECIPE format. The RECIPE format highlights the IDEAS and LINKS of your point and minimizes excessive STYLE. List key IDEAS. Describe actions and transformations (LINKS). Given an IDEA, estimate relevance to PRIS, problems, undeveloped PLANS, and SELF-MAINTENANCE. Keep docs short enough that the title and CONTENT address only one thing. Save selectively and delete frequently. 7.16 Document A word is a doc when it is saved with a name, at least once. Word is to a GOOD DOC (for example, a resume), as action is to goal. To a BAD DOC, a word (for example a diary entry) is to an unnecessary purchase at a tupperware party. Notes are words for comm. Lib is what words to save. Revision is words for pris. Introduce ideas in unambiguous terms. introducing a new topic, provide a succinct, distinctive illustration of the point or merit, in the verbiage you will most likely understand. then describe the link with a taxonomic reference, as follows, where each idea read left to right is a type of or label for the preceding category, implying alternatives at each level. e-psych-teach-2021-unit4-hw-methods_report-intro For this assignment, consider your grandparents. Illustrate the link. At a micro-scale, every dash itself is a link. For example, in the taxonomy, Psych-teach-2021-unit4 the three latter IDEAS qualify the topic, PSYCH. The order of terms from left to right should closely correspond to the order of relevant conditional differences that determine: the pri for the reader. answer: what are the fewest words to help a reader know a topic is irrelevant or truly beneficial? the most similar and relevant concepts to most distinct, rare, and particular to what is being described. the left-most word will be either implied or actual chapter headings. All science that is not directly relevant elsewhere, will fall under PPL-WORK or SELF-HOME. The remaining chapters deal with modes on these basic sources: PRI and ED concern optimizing life. (What about WORD, REVISION, COMM?) In the example above, PSYCH might fall under SELF-BODY, SELF-HOME, PPL, PPL-WORK. Here, we are talking about defining links for purposes of reducing ambiguity. The link is the decision of the sentence that requires the most care. It is simply a bridge, and as such has a basic and plain function. Named links are ACTIONS. Over-spelling the IDEAs leaves an empty link, e-do(the trash) consider what is the manner of spending time, if an action, to ascribing your link. Consider the specific change being undertaken. Some ACTIONS: TAKE, GIVE, MAKE, BUY, SELL, USE/EAT, WORK, WRITE, READ. - Notice these are all verbs of transfer. In instr, the link comes last, and it describes a step in revision. Contextualize with an alternative A plan should inherit or give definitions of new terms. New definitions should especially be accompanied by a true use-case, to protect against a false problem. A pri is the motive for life, and itself is only a named spending of time. A developed pri is an instruction. One generalized is a lesson. 7.17 Scientist A scientist works to win BETS against the UNKNOWN. They are a professional writer, evaluated on two metrics: For their new CONTENT. The net benefit on GOAL outcomes. A scientist-researcher is a WRITER, a data-collector and hypothesis tester. A scientist-scholar is a READER, curating toward theory development and COMM. More will be said about SCIENTIST more broadly. Here we focus strictly on the aspect of a scientist which is to develop the description of the world, properly. 7.18 Framework FRAMEWORK (FRAME) is a cluster of definitions. What metric can be used to compare and test BETs on WORDs? Such a metric requires a general framework for cognition. This is that general framework. Just as a child learns skills from put it in the box to put it together, and solve the problem you creatively set up to solve the impossible, so too the highest cognitive function these days a cooperative one beyond the speed or control of any individual deserves treatment of its abilities and applications in order of processing difficulty and utility; utility in contributing to itself however it sees fit, but especially in its allocation of finite resources. 7.19 THEORY \\[ H1 where P = Cognition, GOOD.P = P(WIT.GOAL.SORT|PRI) \\] Cognitive acts should be engaged in as a pyramid of levels (like food pyramid), number of tasks (width of level). For example, a base height of 4 (levels) = 4 topics on bottom level, 3 on 2nd, 2 on 3rd and 1 on 4th. where the bottom level is the simplest of tasks, such as name and or bin, the next is between order and sort, then between measure and assemble, finally between test and use, until it leaves the pyramid as habit, extinguished, or tasks revised. For example, assuming a GOAL, make an action plan (BLITZ) constrained by number of tasks by type as follows: SORT (base task) NAME, DEF, or MEASURE, MAKE (minimum viable) TEST (EDIT, SIM, REVISE) USE (reliable, helpful) Additional tasks must wait to be addressed until a task of the same level becomes complete and removed from the pyramid, leaving a slot to be replaced. This is a frame that gives a starting point for assessing how and what optimal capacity and boundaries exist for a human as a cognitive being. Above is a proposed initial BET, arrived at by SIM. Heres an example GOOD SIM: NAME a PRI-scope of IRL-events. For example, tasks may differ in how hard and many times actions at various levels need be done; The following properties can be varied by SIM. 1-TASK type definitions, pyramid level definitions. TASK-LEVEL and TASK-COUNT For example, 3 levels starting at 10-count, reducing by 2 (10,8,6), or 5 levels start at 25 reducing by 6 (25,19,13,7,1). The GOAL of SIM is to maximize a BET you take (e.g., vs defining relevant PRIs).

As a process which takes effort, do so to improve, and we will call it REVISION. REVISION is the change of WORDS to improve actions of yourself or others. REVISION is how we know reflection is happening, described here in VERSIONS (v#) of a response. For example, consider the following revisions (v1-3) describing this brief argument: 1: Nobody follows doctors orders. 2: My parents do, religiously. 1: Theyre the exception. 2: Youre not exposed to minorities. v1 1 makes a false generalization. 2 illustrates a counterpoint, and 1 gets mad. 1 dismisses it, and 2 gets mad. v2 1 generalizes from WORK experience. 2 argues with parents experience, and 1 gets mad. 1 dismisses and 2 get mad. v3 1 argues outside 2s experience. 2 uses personal experience, thinking its impenetrable. Failing and hurt, 2 insults. The example aims to illustrate revisions which increase the amount of responsibility, control, and preventable future behavior on part of the writer, without much change in WORD count. 8.2 Plan Good revisions better describe what we know to have happened, and predict what will happen (again). Reality is what determines whether each version is better. Revise prior prompt responses only to help your current prompt response. If your GOAL deals with different assumptions about the truth, change the prompt to whatever gets you to write the most helpful WORDS for your GOAL. For example, a prompt referring to University student experiences should be adapted for your non-University experiences. A common (problematic) assumption is that you are emotionally ready to be SELF-critical. Do not change the prompt so you can be lazy. 8.3 Think! Elsewhere, we will establish variations on ultimate questions. One variant is the superlative presupposition, which becomes an imperative (PLAN). For illustration, all questions presuppose and command, Think! As compliment, all WORDs can be seen as an answer to this question (GOOD or BAD). Supposing just as questions can be revised to their superlatives, we dont bother to ask them, and focus on the superlative of answers. Thus is an example basis of GOOD revision: to bring the particular apprehension to a universally relevant call to action, responding to the implied imperative of all questions, Think. 8.4 Plan The GOAL of WORDS is to express ideas of maximum CAKE tomorrow. Since few WORDS meet these criteria, start by revising toward fewer WORDS. Make IDEAS clear and concrete. Provide just enough CONTEXT to remember the basis of the key ideas. Precision depends on purpose. LIST. Name relevant ideas for GOAL. WRITE a PLAN, (ordered LINKS). DOUBT. Assert the strongest rebuttal to the PLAN. BET. Improve IDEAS and LINKS by addressing weakness and clarity. READ. Wager its CAKE (e.g., Relative to another PLAN). When reflecting, reflect only on how can I help my future SELF? And impose TIME and WORD limits. A bad doc is stream-of-consciousness. 8.5 Prompts Prompts elicit conflicts (truth) between SELF and NORM, to improve PLANS for your GOALS. TIME and WORD limits WORK together to encourage a balance between reflecting on truth and describing it. 8.6 Word Limit WORD limits combat needless WORDS and distracting tangents. A WORD limit keeps your attention. A WORD limit is a proxy for a prompts complexity. Try to write the exact number of WORDS. Good WORD limits require cutting out unhelpful WORDS, change figurative WORDS to concrete, ideally assertive and falsifiable. For every PLAN you make: Assert a WORD limit before writing to be reminded of your initial intentions, and be challenged to express ideas clearly. Become skilled at using only the fewest WORDS necessary, to reveal and clarify CAKE. If you exceed the limit and there is no end in sight, stop and reassess. 8.7 Time Limit The TIME limit dictates how precise your WORDS should be. Use extra TIME to improve WORD choice. For example, given a 50-WORD limit, 1 minute (1m, 50w) encourages free writing with minimal restrictions on quality of thought, while 4 minutes encourages more careful selection of WORDS. 8.8 LESSONs LESSONS are an ordered set of prompts, usually three to four, up to 60 minutes and 250 WORDS. A prompts WORD count is the number of WORDS to be added to your document. Lessons target inconsistencies between reality and PRIS. They are designed to be revisited and revised repeatedly. A 0w prompt means revise, but do not increase the WORD total. The first prompts in LESSONS are warm-ups to direct your attention. They ask for names of IDEAS. The remaining prompts are for thinking, requiring you to make LINKS between your warm-up IDEAS. Done right, you will face some new truths. 8.9 PEER-REVISION Peer revision is a powerful learning tool. Get answers from others. Forget who provides REVISION and how much. The peer WRITER has uncompromised objectivity, and liberty to employ Truth, however harsh.

When you communicate (COMM), skip SELF and talk PRI. Convey the greatest amount of relevant information with greatest likelihood of understanding or convincing. PRI-COMM is the difference between your and NORM-PRI, especially that what your FOOD and CAKE are and why. Say: properties of the answer, not knowing it, an answer for purposes of improving on it. These properties are the properties of [SR][Skilled Reflection]: comparable constraints to establish a reliable subjective experience. until we have a measurable SELF and variation, share the SELF that is CAKE, in 250w. 9.1 Problem Communication happens from one being to another. The function is to direct attention to a circumstance of high importance: sharing information. For example, the vervet screech that specifically means, snake. While the vervet makes or hears calls about threats of immediate, nearby importance, the breadth of human communication can direct attention to circumstances of distant places and times. This is an echo of the breadth of attention and information humans engage. for some reason entangled between information, sharing it, there is subjectivity of importance. The consequence is ambiguity in the value of a communicative act. 9.2 STYLE RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDS is easier than RETRIEVAL from memory, of WORDS to write. Is- savings on revision. Only save docs that you BET will be useful enough later to save TIME, overall. Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE. This is the primary type of COMM we engage in. COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are rereading, a carefully crafted party invite, or a Lease Agreement. The GOAL of COMM is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the inherent and practical problems that arise. 9.3 COMM Writing a WORD creates a static record of a WORD. No person is identical with a future or past SELF, with any other person, and all of these relationships are in part UNKNOWN. (c4.1) The problem of COMM is the difference in meaning between READER and WRITER of the same WORD. Even if you wrote the WORD, your later SELF may read a different meaning for that WORD. GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues. BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the COST of clarity and honesty. PPL vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can vary in precise understanding of meanings. TRUST (usually WRITER more than READER). The real world is particular; each experience is an EXAMPLE. A WORD describes a set of similar experiences. WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of the real world. A WORDs definition is a generalization. As such, WORDS are less precise than reality. better designed to hypothesize and predict. To improve COMM, study the difference between CONTENT and STYLE. 9.4 Difference PRIS between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ. Difference in PRIS alter CONTENT of ideas. Good STYLE is change in WORDS to minimize change in ideas between READER and WRITER. Versions describe identical CONTENT with difference in STYLE between them. A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of the (same) final DOC. For example, you today vs you in five years. 9.5 NORMs COMM NORMs assume READING and WRITING have no intrinsic GOALS. A DOCs arguments for why to READ it are a STYLE called PITCH. Pitch can be accomplished, for example, by stroking the ego and intelligence of the reader. framing attacks as agreeable observations. The maximum common SELF-PRIS across PPL are the optimal arguments for PITCH. E-FOOD vs. CAKE. BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth, a form of bad STYLE. For example, consider the GOAL of describing the properties of apples with the purpose of selling them: CONTENT: Apples are healthy but sugary. STYLE: Apples are tasty and nutritious. BRAND: Apples are healthy. PPL who do not distinguish FOOD from CAKE will be persuaded by BRAND more than PITCH. 9.6 Library LIB is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you WRITE, SAVE, and READ, by organizing it for best application, and providing feedback to help your future decisions to WRITE, SAVE, and READ. The scope of LIB is the collection of your WORDS over a lifetime. is post-WRITING cache to facilitate future production. LIB is to docs as HOME is to possessions. LIB aims to maximize the CAKE of WORDS you save, and ideally, reduce future efforts to PLAN and accomplish PRIS, through making the best of your thoughts easy to find. A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation, none of which helped PLANS. A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF. Library = sum (GOALS + PLANS) / 1 For learning what you dont know you dont know. Potential risks include 40.1. writing, saving, and finding bad docs. 40.2. failure to save or find good docs. Studying links will improve ideas. PLANS, and anything else you write down, should be part of a PRI. Facilitate RETRIEVAL: Index (list) docs worth rereading. Assign a number that indicates its relative importance (abs or relative weight). Add tags and metadata for easier sorting. Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s). Record and study LIB RETRIEVAL patterns. Note the TIME and date now, as you did in the introduction. Graduate This is the end of the book. Put it in your library. Now return to your garden and WORK on your PRIS. 9.7 Reference system Space: this books chapter and line numbering. Time: v2.14 the current book version. For example, a document that elaborates about Trump would begin titled c4.23 v2.14. In version 2.14 of SR, 4 is the chapter PPL, and number 23 is the definition of RLTP. Trump, the article topic, is an example. This is the header format for any subsequent document of an idea I write. 9.8 Answerword The complete set of PPLs LIBs is sufficiently exhaustive to describe all that matters in each and all lives. The efficiently compressed content of this LIB produces a distribution of variation along a median LIB. This is the content of the next book, Answerword. In that book, STYLE is any further optimization to maximize learning. Book 3, Afterword, is the DARPA for thought when the Answerword is muscle-memory. 9.9 Zero Suppose you dont share the same language.

This exercise is a remedy. Task 1. 5m, 50w. Take five minutes to produce the WORDS that are most likely to accomplish your GOALS for the day. This may include describing the GOALS, the PLAN, and/or the DOUBTs. Task 2. 5m, 50w. Copy those 50 WORDS and revise them according to the following instruction. 69.1.
