How real will your dreams get before you die? Betting is confronting costs, habits, unknowns and doubts (CHUD) that stand in the way of your wants and dreams. A bet is a plan template for reconciling reality with CHUD, to accomplish goals. The time that passes and the status of your goal when it runs out are an intersection of reality: the world and you. to name them, is to shed CHUD. Every idea you hold is a bet with a rolling deadline, idiosyncratic successes, and revisions. 3.2 Imagine imagine the most realistic, attainable, best life you could have. Imagine taking the first step and then stay with the thought. listen to the fear that surfaces. never mind how the world has gotten in your way.

Revise plan, updated with CHUD factor predictions. 4. (Record time to do the next bet or goal, revise, etc.) 5. Start the next bet or goal. 3.9 Cost Everything in life, including the opportunity to live, costs you effort. Costs (c2.51) and habits are knowable facts. Observers could independently note and agree on your costs and habits. Costs are the unadjusted record of transactions in your life. Referring to cost is referring to typical transactions for a goal. For example, a relationship with an alcoholic poses a risk of violence. The unadjusted, plain record of everything you have physically done, is your habit. Referring to habit is referring to patterns of behavior. For example, i eat every morning before 9 am. 3.10 Habits The basic pattern of actions you take, however much it helps you or creates suffering, is your habit. A better life costs you more, because it requires actions outside your habit. Habits are your most likely and reliable food or cake actions. Bad habits work against your goals. Good habits are aligned with goals. 3.11 Unknowns If you have not arrived at the goal, there are unknowns. Unknowns are all that are fully out of your control (analogous to statistical ‘error’). For example, a train might stop you from arriving on time. Unknowns are reduced by estimating causes of failure. Unknowns are the gap between your real and perceived costs and habits. Bet to learn as quickly as possible what could maximize your better life. 3.12 Doubt It is natural to fail because of mistakes, even ones within your ability and control to avoid. Doubts are all reliable patterns of failure. For example, “self-fulfilled prophesies”, irrational fear or anxiety; over- or under-estimating your own or others’ habits, anxiety about your future, discomfort toward present reality or distrust in your past. Pro-actively improve your plans by assuming your doubts are present, and bet in a way that tests doubts.
