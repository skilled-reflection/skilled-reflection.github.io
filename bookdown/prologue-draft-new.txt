when i first set out to write SR as a book i quickly realized a singular dumb problem could hang me up forever. the problem is both simple and superficial, and its terms are equally so. the clearest example and product of the problem is as follows: this that I'm writing now, is at least the 15th unique thesis for a preface, and even as i write it I know i am woefully failing. the problem is that, the stake for improperly starting to describe a system, is failed communication. in version one of this book, i deliberately set aside this problem, for the personally more desparate issue, of attempting to name and contain a system, at all. while i succeeded my decided priority, i failed the known order issue, and i must say, as i issue the 2nd version, the poverty of readership and intellectual engagement has crippled me. 
version 2 takes the first essential step in resolving the problem, by streamlining all essential terms and links of the system into a shared frame, called "the garden" (introduced in version one, as concept, but not integrated in practice). in this respect, though, version 2 is proto, at best.

the crippling i mean is as follows - i want to not lose sight of the direction of innovation that i set out, and must continue, and in developing SRv2, i risk the infinite loop of enabling the breadcrumb trail further.

however, i pen this alternative prologue
at the advent of having spelled out critical details, via example, of the problem. the spelling should show you in backward fashion
why and how i write the way i do.
i hope that for those who fell off the previous train,
you find renewed interest to ride again.
