# intro
## you and me
this book uses pronouns
as follows:
you are the specific reader
that you are aware is currently reading.
I am the one writing,
but I also specifcally
envision you as me,
as i talk to you.

for the first half of this book,
you don't need to be
distracted by all the other
"you's" reading,
and "you's" you bet i 
don't understand
or have in mind.
the second half
will offer many
straightforward ways
to be critical
in a way that if you have it,
will be handed to you on a platter.
during the first
half of the book,
as often as you can,
remind yourself that
you are the only
that needs to be worried
about applying the words i'm saying
to you,
right now.

by the time we get to ppl,
of course i will be talking
about you, relative to
all of us.
we are your audience,
your destination gardens,
your friends and loved ones,
and for example, a complete stranger
you will never meet,
i, student0.

you are ppl too,
but not here, yet.
you are first a person
when you author bets,
and much more
when you have something to be a student for.
the catch about being a student
is that you're going to need
to write your lessons,
or write someone else's.
(don't worry, you're getting to ppl status.)

you first learn words for plans.
as you do this well
you begin to document
how to turn the lights on yourself.

now, you are ready.
when you come out of yourself;
tomorrow and years later,
just as you've waited all your life wondering
will i ever tell him?
will i ever tell anyone?
will i ever tell myself?

you are ready to learn
one more thing.

you are ready to learn
to communicate.

now, i'll tell you,
student1-v2.15,
one of the main reasons
i want to teach you to communicate,
is so that i have someone to talk to.
i realise that sounds
terrifyingly awkward or inappropriate
for me to mean me and you
the way i have carefully
disambiguated.
that could be one of the things we talk about.
there are much more important things.
this book is also one.
but just like for you,
i too have reasons
that don't belong in the book,
but the book belongs in,
to bring it to life.

even as you
tell yourself how to keep the lights on,
you'll need to learn to
communicate to the self
that would have forgotten.
you'll need to pitch
across pri's, the content
into his style,
to afford clearest success.

after that,
as far as i understand,
it is just more turtles
all the way down.
