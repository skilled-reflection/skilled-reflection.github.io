# WORDS 

## Cognition 
### PITCH  
1.	Like any book, this book uses WORDS to describe the world and its 
conditions.
2.	This chapter is about the act of describing, itself.
3.	This chapter can be reduced to the following problem and solution. 
4.	WORDS said (out loud or written) and understood (heard or read) are 
not usually what PPL mean. 
5.	They do not reflect what PPL want or need.
6.	By engaging the gap between WORDS and reality, you increase SELF-
awareness (BET).
7.	Better WORDS mean more practical understanding and expectations, 
more complete desires, and 
8.	the capacity to make a concrete PLAN for achieving your GOALS. 
9.	This will naturally include healthier communication and more 
rewarding relationships.
10.	A community with better WORDS has clearer idea sharing, 
synthesizing, developing, teaching and learning.

### Problem  

11.	Speaking your mind is difficult.
12.	A memory system dealing with language is tasked to translate 
thoughts into the right WORDS from thousands. 
13.	It is prone to inaccuracies.
14.	Similarly, a listener focused on comprehending, is not likely to monitor 
all the incidental priming effects of WORDS on a memory system. 
15.	WORDS said and heard impact both parties' beliefs and behaviors.
16.	These effects are each discussed in terms of how WORDS can be used 
for the better or worse.

### Kinds and Uses  
17.	Saying WORDS is a very small physical action, to describe real actions 
and consequences. 
18.	Hearing and understanding a WORD are also a small action, that 
engages with WORDS-- a description about the real world.
19.	The issue is that descriptions can be more and less right, more and less 
helpful, and we have little guidance on how to use them.

### WORD as BET  

20.	Every WORD itself is a BET on hypotheticals, which can be true (reality) or false (fantasy).
21.	You can think through far more situations with WORDS, than you can 
(or should) act out. 
22.	Your GOALS can be described in WORDS, and WORDS can be easily 
crossed out and revised.
23.	A PLAN is a BET on a winning arrangement of WORDS that result in the 
GOAL.

### WORD as simulation  
24.	WORDS efficiently simulate possible worlds. 
25.	Good WORDS maximize productivity of thought, move you beyond 
pitfalls of CHUD, direct attention to PRIS, and predict reality; improve 
decisions and make you smarter.

### WORD PLAN  
26.	By thinking about all WORDS you experience (LIB), you can take 
control to limit your WORD use toward more productive ones, 
improving READ and WRITE decisions, increasing focus and TIME for 
GOALS.
27.	Bad WORDS keep CHUD expensive, and waste TIME.
28.	The COST of an individual WORD is tiny, but we say tens of thousands 
per day (Levelt). 
29.	Reading, thinking, saying, and writing a WORD perpetuates that 
WORD's IDEA over others, either moving you toward a GOAL, or your 
HABIT.

## Speak/Write
### WRITE PLAN  

30.	Speak, write, initiate or respond only in limited duration and WORDS 
dictated by intended outcome. 
31.	Use WORDS empirically, with a comparison group (vs) and quantity in 
mind.
32.	Ideas are more important than authorship. 
33.	Do not use a WORD that is more of a Lie. 
34.	Say the truth or be quiet. 
35.	Use WORDS for decisions, not emotions. 
36.	Use WORDS to facilitate PRIS. Do not write PLANS you won't follow. 
37.	Stop talking when action (or listening) is needed.

### READ PLAN

38.	Listen / read when you need to learn / connect. 
39.	Limit duration/WORDS needed to assess consent.
40.	Distrust ego, and take nothing personally 
41.	Investigate the empirical CAKE of WORDS.
42.	Revise to believe, and revise PLANS into ones you'd follow.
43.	Remove / ignore style. 
44.	Assert boundaries against exaggerated WORDS or unreliable ones.

### EXAMPLE and IDEA

45.	An EXAMPLE is an individual, particular event or object, of reality. An 
example with consequence is a USE-CASE. An example in-principle is a 
HYPE (hypothetical/hype).
46.	WORDS are one of two types:
46.1.	LINKS: WORDS that give relationship between EXAMPLES, IDEAS, 
describe ACTIONS, ROLES, and transformations
46.2.	IDEAS: WORDS that refer to EXAMPLES.
46.3.	An IDEA is a set of criteria that LINK EXAMPLES as similar (vs not).
46.4.	The most basic IDEA classifies EXAMPLES as A or not-A. "blue" is 
an IDEA that certain colored things are BLUE (A), and all other 
colors are not BLUE.
46.5.	Good IDEAS group EXAMPLES in a way that directs attention 
toward PLANS and GOALS. Bad IDEAS distract.
46.6.	The right LINK between ideas is the foundation of every thought, 
recipe or terrible calculation.

### ROLE Scientist

47.	A scientist works to win BETS against the UNKNOWN. They are a 
professional writer, evaluated on two metrics:
    1.	For their new CONTENT. 
    2.	The net benefit on GOAL outcomes.
 
    
48.	A scientist-researcher is a WRITER, a data-collector and hypothesis tester. 

49.	A scientist-scholar is a READER, curating toward theory development and COMM.
