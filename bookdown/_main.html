<li><strong>Introduction.</strong> This book is centered on you, the specific reader that you are aware is currently reading. I am the one writing.</li>
<li><strong>SELF.</strong> For now you need only worry about applying the words I’m saying to your actual self, and determining exactly what or who that is.</li>
<li><strong>PRI.</strong> This is the good “worry,” because the fact is you may as well <a href="#priorities">identify and own yourself before you die</a>.</li>
<li><strong>PPL.</strong> You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are <a href="#ppl">PPL</a>. You will be too, but not yet.</li>
<li><strong>BET.</strong> First you’ll <a href="#bet">BET</a> about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing.</li>
<li><strong>Education.</strong> At that point you should become <a href="#education">a STUDENT</a> of better methods.</li>
<li><strong>WORDs.</strong> As a STUDENT you’ll simulate methods efficiently with <a href="#words">WORDs</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Revision.</strong> You want an answer to the same questions (below) as the rest. <a href="#revisions">Revise</a> your WORDs until they are uniquely you.</li>
<li><strong>COMM.</strong> Then you may contextualize and <a href="#communication">communicate</a> who you are among PPL.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">0.3</span> Index of Definitions</h2>
<p>This book attempts to balance convention and new ideas. The core ideas are foregrounded right here for convenience, however they will make the most sense within the narrative context of this book. Links to those primary contexts follow each definition. Note that, because this list is statically generated, there will be slight discrepancies with definitions in main text as sections become updated. (Last revised: v2.15).</p>
<ul>
<li>A GOAL names an ideal future outcome, and requires a PLAN to intentionally achieve it. (<a href="#core-concepts"><strong>c2.38.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>A PLAN comprises WORDS that facilitate your GOAL. (<a href="#core-concepts"><strong>c2.44.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>A COST is what’s materially required for GOALs–an amount and kind of FORCE. (<a href="#core-concepts"><strong>c2.49.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>FOOD is the necessary and sufficient material to satisfy these needs. (<a href="#self-1"><strong>c2.56.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>CAKE is all non-FOOD GOALs. (<a href="#self-1"><strong>c2.57.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>SELF is the GOAL to MAINTAIN HABIT, ideally to maximize BET outcomes. (<a href="#self-1"><strong>c2.58.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>HOME is the collection of tools, materials and money (which support HABITs). (<a href="#home"><strong>c2.59.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>PRI is management of the GOALS in your life (and common themes therein). (<a href="#attention-and-time"><strong>c3.33.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>PPL are different VERSIONs of each others’ PRI (WRITER and READER are different, too).(<a href="#ppl"><strong>c4.1.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>TIME is the constant (or denominator) for PRI and FORCES (LIB and MEMORY). (<a href="#attention-and-time"><strong>c3.38.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>MONEY is traded for maintenance of, or insurance for SELF and CAKE. (<a href="#ppl"><strong>c4.09.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>WORK is performing a specific task on a collective garden for MONEY. (<a href="#work"><strong>c4.10.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>NORMS are the “average” person’s HABITs, including WORK and CHUD. (<a href="#work"><strong>c4.13.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>A FORCE is any cause of change including actions. (<a href="#work"><strong>c4.20.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>
<li>MAINTENANCE is any recurring COST to neither move toward nor away from a GOAL. (<a href="#work"><strong>c4.21.</strong></a>)<br />
</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Your Garden</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Imagine your life takes place in a garden.</p></li>
<li><p>Visualizing your life as a garden allows you to ground actions and PLANS.</p></li>
<li><p>The mind analyzes well with visual space.</p></li>
<li><p>In this garden we’ll consider all your biological needs – eating, sleeping especially – as literal.</p></li>
<li><p>Your plants are GOALS, and gardening is your PLAN.</p></li>
<li><p>FOOD and CAKE exists in the form of fruit from plants.</p></li>
<li><p>Whatever it takes to obtain your CAKE you can consider as an act of gardening.</p></li>
<li><p>Every one of your life ambitions, GOALS, is buried in the ground as seeds.</p></li>
<li><p>Finding a life partner, acquiring a car or promotion, or resolving a conflict with
your childhood friend are all matters spread across the dirt in need of water,
sunlight, and–most important–your TIME.</p></li>
<li><p>Other GOALS, like your favorite hobbies, or TV shows, take little WORK and
grow almost anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Whether they are dear to you or weeds, if they take your TIME, they are PLANTS
in your garden.</p></li>
<li><p>Except that they start as seeds.</p></li>
<li><p>And what do you do with seeds to make plants? You garden, dear human, you
garden.</p></li>
<li><p>All actions toward a plant are according to PLAN.</p></li>
<li><p>All actions toward your SELF are to be considered literal in the garden
metaphor.</p></li>
<li><p>For example, if you need to eat, or go to the bathroom, you physically go to the
place and literally do the deed.</p></li>
<li><p>(There will be no pooping on plants, or a pooping plant in this garden.)</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, in the garden you are still a normal human bound to a normal space and
time, capable of:
18.1. acting according to bodily need,
18.2. moving about space, and
18.3. gardening.
Today</p></li>
<li><p>Today, you are looking out across the entire garden.</p></li>
<li><p>What has already been planted? What will you add and how much TIME will you
devote to those GOALS?</p></li>
<li><p>Every seed you plant – even an abstract one like passing a course or making a
friend– implies things in and out of your control like WORK and weather, or
beyond your awareness, like what your boss loses sleep over.</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate on the final products of your garden.</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a more important plant that deserves your TIME today?</p></li>
<li><p>Meditate on the priorities of your WORK. Do two plants grow better when
together?</p></li>
<li><p>Make a quick and accurate assessment, but don’t sit here all morning thinking
about it.</p></li>
<li><p>A garden is for working in, to get the FOOD and CAKE you need.</p></li>
<li><p>What do you need to cultivate, today?</p></li>
<li><p>What do you want to cultivate in this life?</p></li>
<li><p>First, you want what your body and mind best respond to. Many of these seeds
will be obvious.</p></li>
<li><p>It is up to you how curious you are for what better life is possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The day is too short to try everything, and many things are not worth trying.</p></li>
<li><p>There is not always harm to planting something that does not grow, but
sometimes there is.</p></li>
<li><p>You could run out of space, TIME, or energy that could have been devoted to
better crops;</p></li>
<li><p>You might get a weak yield for trying to grow something not suitable in your
climate, or</p></li>
<li><p>find you have no taste or stomach for the fruit.</p></li>
<li><p>In the garden, the COSTS of GOALS are grounded in their most basic sense: TIME
and attention.</p></li>

<li><p>A GOAL names an ideal future reality, comprises a PLAN to increase its
likelihood, associated with CHUD.</p></li>
<li><p>These three things encompass all cognitive activity related to reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Call anything that could be true, but isn’t right now, a GOAL, and any effort in support of making it true a PLAN.</p></li>
<li><p>It is <em>your</em> GOAL if you aim to increase its probability of being true.</p></li>
<li><p>A GOAL can be finite or persistent, singular or recurring, or realistic or not.</p></li>
<li><p>If you will need to do something before it is in your hand, it requires a PLAN.</p></li>
<li><p>A PLAN is any combination of WORDS where the writing or reading of them aims
to improve the chance or decrease the COST of achieving your GOAL.</p></li>
<li><p>Most PLANS are instructions (INSTR) for learning, making, changing, reminding.
45.1. Product INSTR are a PLAN to maximize satisfaction and minimize liability.
45.2. For example, lamp INSTR will likely suggest not to put it in water.</p></li>
<li><p>A DOC is a PLAN for GOALS to complete a linguistic product
46.1. Example DOCs include a resume or epitaph on a tombstone.</p></li>
<li><p>LESSONS are a PLAN template for thinking.
47.1. Read and complete LESSON steps in order.</p></li>
<li><p>TOOLS are physical or mental objects that help you accomplish your GOAL.</p></li>
<li><p>What is materially required–muscle energy, cash, brain power–is COST.</p></li>
<li><p>All COSTS can be reduced to TIME.</p></li>
<li><p>COST is any action that has a direct exchange.</p></li>

<li>In your garden you have the seeds and sprouts of the best you could want, and the most important of what you need.</li>
<li>There are two important things to keep in mind, however clear things may seem right now.<br />
</li>
<li>The first is to always leave room for your goals to change, if and when you achieve them. Think of what you can grow from the seeds of the best apple in your crop.</li>
<li>The second is that much of what you could achieve, you won’t, before the day is over, nor before you die.</li>
<li>Before there was a garden, you lived as if you wouldn’t die. At least some of your GOALs assume <em>tomorrow</em> is a good time to start.<br />
</li>
<li>I did, at least. The list of my GOALS grew like a wild vine and I found myself
overwhelmed by what else I wanted, and yet an inability to equalize various
goals.</li>
<li>The very difficult task of your priorities, at their core, is to establish the optimal intersection of finite time and infinite, ever-changing desire.</li>
<li>For example, sleep. About 4 hours daily is a vital priority for everyone (FOOD), but sleeping in on the weekends is usually not (CAKE).</li>
<li>In your garden, you are limited in what you can do in one day, and in one lifetime.</li>
<li>Even if you build machines to work fields that stretch out to the horizons,</li>
<li>you can only eat so much in a day and a lifetime.</li>
<li>How do you most want to spend your time?</li>
<li>If your GOAL is to obtain something you do not yet have and have never
tasted, be careful. It may not satisfy you how you imagine.</li>
<li>Suppose your goal takes 300 hours of labor.</li>
<li>You might spend 10 years accruing the time on task, or immerse yourself
and achieve your GOAL in under 1 year.</li>
<li>Any true GOAL has a specific optimal deadline.</li>
<li>Today, you grow the best apple you can,</li>
<li>yet having tasted it, you might discover a more refined GOAL is closer to
your heart.</li>
<li>Whether this apple is FOOD or CAKE, the more you align with yourself, the
more you will see your GOALS differently than you first conceived of them.</li>

<p>you have three places of life.
the first is on your garden

the second is away from your garden,
getting something someone else made,
for your needs.
the third is making something
at a job,
to get money so you can pay
for those things others made
that you want.</p>
<p>the simple equation
that each of us solves
is this one;
what proportion
of time,
and for what goods,
do we spend at each of the three locations?</p>
<p>from these datum alone
we have all we need to know
as a psychological baseline

the good news is
you can go back to your garden
at any time.*
you will have to figure out what to do there,

you’ll need to learn a lot to make it worthwhile.</p>

if its a company, many people want it.</p>

you are work for hire.
even if your subject-matter is reality
(which it usually should be to a good degree,
and also obscured by capitalist goals)
it is your job to
understand the shared terms of reality
and speak from it.
this is the opposite of
understanding reality from yourself.
of course it means starting

<p>* <strong>You could think of people as seeds in your garden, but this is an over-application of seeds; and its unnecessary.</strong>
2. Maybe they are your friend, and need help with some unruly vines, or
maybe you just like their apples.
3. Sometimes, PPL will contribute to your goals, as if bringing water to crops you didn’t recognize need them. 4. Sometimes PPL will try to water your crops when they don’t need watering.
5. Sometimes visiting their garden will bring up your morale, or get you a bag of apples to take home.
6. Sometimes you’ll need to water some crops that need to be watered, because the sight of their neglect cannot be ignored.
7. Keep in mind that the challenges that sometimes overwhelm you are the same kind others deal with, but not always the same amount and at the same time.

<li>Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE.
This is the primary type of COMM we engage in.</li>
<li>COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.1.2</span> COMM problem</h3>

<li>Writing a WORD creates a static record of a WORD.</li>
<li>No person is identical with a future or past SELF, with any other
person, and all of these relationships are in part UNKNOWN. (<a href="#ppl">c4.1</a>)</li>
<li>The problem of COMM is the difference in meaning between READER
and WRITER of the same WORD.</li>
<li>Even if you wrote the WORD, your later SELF may read a different
meaning for that WORD.</li>
<li>GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues.</li>
<li>BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the COST of clarity and
honesty.</li>
<li>PPL vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can vary in
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>precise understanding of meanings.</li>
<li>TRUST (usually WRITER more than READER).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The real world is particular; each experience is an EXAMPLE.</li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of the real world.</li>

<li>COMM NORMs assume READING and WRITING have no intrinsic GOALS.</li>

<li>The maximum common SELF-PRIS across PPL are the optimal
arguments for PITCH. E-FOOD vs. CAKE.</li>
<li>BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth, a form of bad STYLE.</li>

<p>As a human you are endowed with words.
Too much so. The pervasive impulsivity of putting-to-words means you are often deprived

For a moment, forget those words.
Let’s engage with the manners of communicating
using a vocabulary of 2.</p>
<p>Please answer each question with “0” or “1.”
Do not dwell on any one question.

that indeed, you do not have power over these things, give up
attempts to control, and welcome your feelings.</li>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">14</span> “Self-testing”</h1>
<p>All of this book is a lesson in simulation,
because this is a book with words in it,
and words are simulations of reality.
This lesson is an exercise to fearlessly
take action. Since you’ll be writing,
it works better if the “action” to take is,
itself, a writing task.
It could be an upcoming exam, or writing your will.
The exercise works whether you are
75% done or 5% prepared to start.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1. 3m, 40w.</strong></p>
<p>Think about the challenging task you’ve identified.
Finish a sentence like this:
“The purpose of this task is to…”
Perhaps “demonstrate my knowledge of the endocrine system,” or
“communicate my values and divvy up my valuables.”</p>
<p>So that I don’t continue to prime your death, the remainder of this lesson will focus on the youthful experience of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2. 2m, 0w.</strong></p>
<p>Picture someone who doesn’t struggle to do this task.
They would score 100% or write the perfect paper/assignment.
Assume they weren’t born able to do this.
How did they get that skill?
Edit the same 4 things to try to make them more concrete and tractable.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3. 8m, 100w.</strong></p>
<p>Assume that ideal performer writes a custom quiz on
the very areas you’re struggling with.
Write quiz questions that tests your learning objectives.
For example, I’m working on a paper that deals with
how talking happens in the brain.
A question in my quiz is, “define the two contrasting theoretical
positions in 15 words, each.”</p>
<p><strong>Task 4. 2m, 0w.</strong></p>
<p>Revise your quiz so that it would take about 30 minutes for your expert to complete, with questions that can be answered in 5 to 25 words.
Add word and time limits for each question.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5. 20-25m.</strong></p>
<p>Take your quiz.</p>
