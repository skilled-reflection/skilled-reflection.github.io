## Dear me,  

### Your life 
1.	Read this book because you're ready to.
2.	You are going to die someday. This book is for you if there is something in the 
meantime worth maximizing.
3.	Please engage your life. 
This book is meant to help you understand and take action, starting right now.

### is
4.	Please get a pencil and note the date and TIME, right now: ______-______ (YYMMDD-HHMM). 
5.	The WORDS in this book are meaningful only when you apply them to your life.
6.	If you wrote the date and time as requested in step 4, you have proven enough to yourself that you are open to trying 
new ideas. You are prepared to grow and continue reading.
7.	If you left the line blank, you might tell yourself you are open to new ideas. You 
will be right when you complete the task. 
8.	Either write the TIME above or stop reading, and take a better action to improve 
your life, right now.

### a game.
9.	From now on, every WORD you (or I) say is a PLAN for action.
10. That PLAN is meaningless until you take that action, whether GOOD or BAD. 
11.	Reasons are a needless STYLE that can be assumed at will; 
12. They are rarely provided in this book.

## Go Camping  

13.	This book presents seemingly obvious facts of life missing with yourself and between people.
14.	To see this, consider going on a camping trip. 
    1. Look at the clock, now and determine when you should expect to arrive. 
    2. Whatever that time, when you arrive, you will likely over- -prepare, under-prepare, or be 1-3 hours late.
    3. Or you're an experienced camper.
15. Whether you're an experienced camper or not, this is your only shot at a lifelong camping trip for yourself on Earth. 
16. My guess is you are very likely late to your own life.

### on Earth, or in this
17. This is the book to assure you that you're not forgetting something or over-thinking your ambitions.
18.	Your primary challenge is to find and repair the disconnect between your mind's image of TIME, and the one you are physically bound to. 
19.	If you fail, you will die in two worlds, the world you imagine you could have 
lived, and the one you did. 

### two part book.
20. You, however, would like to ace your own life.
21. Part one of this book (The Garden) gives you all the general answers, and the basic tools for finding the answers particular to you.
22. Part two teaches you how to (re)build your tools.

### and eat right.
23. The first task is to fix misperceptions of time ([c1.18][on Earth, or in this]): 
    1. Be exact about what you need vs. what you want.
22.	Now, suppose you are hungry. 
23. In this book, FOOD refers to needs and CAKE refers to wants.
24. You must practice discerning what is which until it is second-nature.
25. Then, all decisions can be made as follows: 
    1. If hungry, eat FOOD.
    2. If full, prepare and pack FOOD.
    3. If time, eat or prepare CAKE.

## Be homeless  

### Come back. 
26.	Likely at this point you have slipped into thinking this is a book discussing a philosophy, but it is not. 
27. FOOD vs CAKE is not understood and solved as a mental exercise in your living room, but by experiencing and paying attention. 
28. What's more, if you don't have a living room, CAKE can be painfully obvious.

### Or like it.
29.	The odds are you aren't homeless and avoid having to be.
30. So consider other major life stressors.  
    1. You couldn't find your car in the middle of winter. 
    2. You went camping without waterproof gear and it rained. 
    3. For weeks your shower only produced ice cold water.
    4. You were isolated in your house for two years during a global pandemic. 

### What happens is,
31.	Your habit protests for a change in PLANS.
32.	However small or profound the suffering or its threat:
33. There is initially terror, frustration and suffering. 
34. Enduring, suffering will change.
35. You will need far less FOOD than you thought, giving more time and quality CAKE you really desire.


## The Garden Narrative
36.	The Garden foregrounds the things we often lose sight of when conceptualizing 
life GOALS: life is brief, and we are mortal. 
37.	It is a mental model of reality, designed to bring clarity. 
38.	Your Garden is your GOALS put on key IDEAS of this book.
39.	You need the Garden to combat the other strength of your mind, its inherently 
idealistic nature, which sets you up for failure and suffering.
40.	In these chapters, the second half revisits the key ideas in more formal 
language.

## This book's FOOD.  

41.	WORDS in all capital letters are IDEAS that have specific definitions that differ 
slightly from conventional use. 
42.	For example, "WORK" is an IDEA referring to "careers", but not 'yard WORK'. 
43.	Do not overlook the nuances for these terms, they are the result of careful decisions about the FOOD and CAKE of the IDEAs.
44. (EMPTY) 
45.	Use the enumeration of ideas to cross-reference.
46. The item immediately above is "c1.45". "c1" referring to the chapter "Introduction", and "45" to the numbered IDEA.
47.	This system will be taken advantage of in future revisions.
48. Most chapter concepts are a category of goals, and offer generalizable guidance for your plans. 
49. Like food vs cake, the habits relevant to your goals can be closer to food, or excessive like cake.
50. In the context of definitions, they will be referred to instead, as "good" and "bad".
51. For example, c8.60.
