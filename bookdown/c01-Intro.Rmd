## Dear me,  

1.	Read this book because you're ready to.
2.	You are going to die someday. This book is for you if there is something in the 
meantime worth maximizing.
3.	Please engage your life. This book is meant to help you break through mental 
barriers, into action, starting right now.
4.	Please get a pencil and note the date and TIME, right now: ______-______ (YYMMDD-HHMM). 
5.	The WORDS in this book are meaningful only when you apply them to your life.
6.	If you wrote the date and time as requested in step 4, you have proven enough to yourself that you are open to trying 
new ideas. You are prepared to grow and continue reading.
7.	If you left the line blank, you might tell yourself you are open to new ideas. You 
will be right when you complete the task. 
8.	Either write the TIME above or stop reading, and take a better action to improve 
your life, right now.
9.	Every WORD you say to yourself is at best a PLAN for action, meaningless until 
you take that action. 
10.	Consider every WORD I write a PLAN to improve your actions.
11.	Reasons for the PLAN are always less important than consequences of following 
them, often omitted. 
12.	What is important will appear, and what isn't will be forgotten. 

    Sincerely,

## Go Camping  

13.	This book presents seemingly obvious facts of life, and yet they are precisely what is essential to a deeper integration with yourself and between people.
14.	The first way to see this is to consider going on a camping trip, right now.
15.	Unless this is routine for you, you will likely over- or under-prepare. Most people will be 1-3 hours late.
16. Whether you're an experienced camper or not, this is your only shot at a lifelong camping trip for yourself on Earth, and my guess is you are very likely late to your own life.
17. This is the book to assure you that you're not forgetting something or over-thinking your ambitions.
18.	Your primary challenge is to find and repair the disconnect between your mind's image of TIME, and the one you are physically bound to. 
19.	If you fail, you will die in two worlds, the world you imagine you could have 
lived, and the one you did. 

20. You'll read this book carefully, because you would like to not only pass, but ace your own life.
21. Part one of this book (The Garden) gives you all the general answers, and the basic tools for finding the answers particular to you.
22. Part two teaches you how to take apart and rebuild your tools, to whatever standard of a perfect self you choose to pursue.

23. The first task to master will resolve most issues of mis-perceived time (c1.18): Be exact about what you need vs. what you want.
22.	Now, suppose you are hungry, and you must choose between finding FOOD or CAKE. 
23. In this book, FOOD refers to needs and CAKE refers to wants.
24. You must practice this so much that you can instantaneously determine which part of your actions  is FOOD and which is CAKE.
25. Then, no matter what you will need to plan or respond to, (however complicated the camping trip), you can trust you won't be late.
25.	Because when you know what is FOOD and CAKE in a fluent and generative way, then planning and executing is a simple two step process: 
    1. Get and prepare (pack) all FOOD.
    2. Get and prepare the best CAKE--that time allows. 

27.	Now, stop. Likely at this point you have slipped into thinking this is a book discussing a philosophy, but it is not. 
28. FOOD vs CAKE is not understood and solved as a mental exercise in your living room, but by experiencing and paying attention. 
29. What's more, you can discover more room for CAKE when you are so far from your living room that you don't even know where it is, because you're homeless and you don't have one. 

## Be homeless

29.	The odds are you aren't and haven't been, and will very much avoid ever being homeless. 
30. So consider any and all other surprising and scary experiences in your life.  
    1. You couldn't find your car in the middle of winter. 
    2. You went camping without waterproof gear and it rained. 
    3. For weeks your shower only produced ice cold water.
    4. You were isolated in your house for two years during a global pandemic. 
    
31.	In the first moments, there is shock and terror, frustration and suffering. Your 
habit protests for a change in PLANS.
32.	However small or profound the suffering or its threat, if you endure for long enough, there will be a noticeable shift in your HABIT. What you call suffering will change.
33. The more you pay close attention to your desires and needs, you will find yourself needing far less FOOD than you originally thought, in order to get more of the quality CAKE you really desire.


## The Garden Narrative
36.	The Garden foregrounds the things we often lose sight of when conceptualizing 
life GOALS: life is brief, and we are mortal. 
37.	It is a mental model of reality, designed to bring clarity. 
38.	Your Garden is your GOALS put on key IDEAS of this book.
39.	You need the Garden to combat the other strength of your mind, its inherently 
idealistic nature, which sets you up for failure and suffering.
40.	In these chapters, the second half revisits the key ideas in more formal 
language.

## This book's FOOD.  

41.	WORDS in all capital letters are IDEAS that have specific definitions that differ 
slightly from conventional use. 
42.	For example, "WORK" is an IDEA referring to "careers", but not 'yard WORK'. 
43.	Do not overlook the nuances for these terms, they are the result of careful decisions about the FOOD and CAKE of the IDEAs.
44. (EMPTY) 
45.	Use the ennumeration of ideas to cross-reference.
46. The item immediately above is "c1.45". "c1" referring to the chapter "Introduction", and "45" to the numbered IDEA.
47.	This system will be taken advantage of in future revisions.
48. Most chapter concepts are a category of goals, and offer generalizable guidance for your plans. 
49. Like food vs cake, the habits relevant to your goals can be closer to food, or excessive like cake.
50. In the context of definitions, they will be referred to instead, as "good" and "bad".
51. For example, c8.60.
