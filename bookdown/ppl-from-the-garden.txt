Now is the time for you to see
what you probably expected to.
Every time you read an email,
look at social media or text,
you are at least at the perimeter of your garden
looking elsewhere,
but hopefully at least there-there

that's one side of 
relationship
BETs.
(The better bets on the world;
In a rltp, one is the better and
the other is the bet and bet on.

the other side
is all we do for you
that you need.
for so much of your
day, living awareness,
and dreams,
you are outside your garden
looking for a GOOD
for you.
Whether to keep you alive,
made and prepared food,
shelter,
you are gone.

(for most of us,
however,)
you're gone for most of the time
to WORK.

## first intermission
you have three places of life.
the first is on your garden
making your life and meeting your needs.
the second is away from your garden,
getting something someone else made,
for your needs.
the third is making something
at a job,
to get money so you can pay 
for those things others made
that you want.

the simple equation
that each of us solves
is this one;
what proportion
of time,
and for what goods,
do we spend at each of the three locations?

from these datum alone
we have all we need to know
as a psychological baseline
for each individual difference.

if you don't like
working for goods,
the good news is
you can go back to your garden
at any time.*
you will have to figure out what to do there,
but you're welcome to it.
stay in your house,
or plant something.
you'll need to learn a lot to make it worthwhile.

resolved:
come up with a planned ratio of time
spent at each.

spend only as much time needed
to work to 
earn only enough time learning
how to spend the least time needed
to make it real.


## part two: rules of work
the first rule of work
is what brought you here:
money.
you are here for it,
and in exchange you will
do something that at least one person
wants you do to.
if its a company, many people want it.

you can think of this simpler,
like a communist.
what you do is for another,
just like the basic cute way
you first imagined what it might mean
to go "visit" another's garden.





## part three: shared thinking
if you have a job
that pays you to think,
- (an analysis or coding or writing job for example)
then pay mind something most don't:
you are work for hire.
even if your subject-matter is reality
(which it usually should be to a good dregree,
and also obscured by capitalist goals)
it is your job to
understand the shared terms of reality
and speak from it.
this is the opposite of
understanding reality from yourself.
of course it means starting
with your own understanding,
and then yet translating it
as you understand needs be
to speak what most know
the identical experience as.

let this section be the prequel
to peer-review
in education.
