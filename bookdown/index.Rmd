Skilled Reflection is a framework to help you make objective sense of your subjective reality. 

## Questions  
1.  You.  How am I and what do I need?
2.	Self. What must I do to have it? 
3.  Priorities. What actions maximize cake in my life?    
4.	Others. What are people?   
5.	Bet. How do I take action?   
6.	Learn. How do I figure out a better plan for my life?    
7.	Words. What are they good for?  
8.	Revision. What would your life look like on paper? 
9.  Communication. How can we help each other?

## Author's Note  
This book attempts to balance convention and new ideas. If something does not seem to make sense, refer to the definitions of the "core ideas" in the [Index of Definitions][Index of Definitions].  

This is an early copy of Skilled Reflection, and much of it is still in development. Thank you for your patience. I welcome any and all constructive feedback. Check back later for a revised and updated version.
