## You

1.  You and I:
    0.  **Introduction.** This book is centered on you, the specific reader that you are aware is currently reading. I am the one writing.
    1.  **SELF.** For now, focus on applying these words to your actual [SELF][SELF], and determining exactly what or who that is.
    2.  **PRI.** Identify and own your [PRIs][Priorities] before you die.
    3.  **PPL.** You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are [PPL][PPL]. You will be too, but not yet.
    4.  **BET.** First you'll [BET][BET] about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing.
    5.  **Education.** At that point you should become [a STUDENT][Education] of better methods.
    6.  **WORDs.** As a STUDENT you'll simulate methods efficiently with [WORDs].
    7.  **Revision.** You want an answer to the same questions (below) as the rest. [Revise][Revisions] your WORDs until they are uniquely you.
    8.  **COMM.** Then you may contextualize and [communicate][Communication] who you are among PPL.
2.  Until then, you and I and they are all the same.

## Questions

3.  Any questions?

    0.  You. How am I and what do I need?
    1.  Self. What must I do to have it?
    2.  Priorities. What actions maximize my life?
    3.  Others. What are people?
    4.  Bet. How do I take action?
    5.  Learn. How do I figure out a better plan for my life?
    6.  Words. What are they good for?
    7.  Revision. What would my life look like on paper?
    8.  Communication. How do I relate to or help others?

## Scope

4.  A book with defined terms is a book for humans.
5.  The following list describes the critical concepts that this book deals with and by impliciation, what it does not deal with.
6.  After each definition is a link to its primary context in the book.
7.  Note that there may be slight discrepancies with definitions in main text as sections become updated. (Last revised: v2.15).

## Draft

8.  This is an early copy of Skilled Reflection, and much of it is still in development. Thank you for your patience. I welcome any and all constructive feedback ([skilledreflection\@gmail.com](mailto:skilledreflection@gmail.com){.email}). Check back later for a revised and updated version.

## Version

9.  When I first set out to write SR as a book I quickly realized a problem could hang me up forever, both simple and superficial.

10. It is the problem of what order to present the information, so that its truth is easily learnable and most evident.

11. In Version 1 of this book, I deliberately set aside this problem, in order to name and contain the system of thinking.

12. Version 2 takes the first step in remediation by streamlining all essential terms and links of the system into a shared frame, called "the Garden" (introduced in version one). Even still, in this respect version 2 is only a working prototype at best.

13. I pen this Forward at the advent of betting my life on Version 3 (2022-08-30). I cannot promise if / when it will surface, but if you are curious, do not wait. You can find Version 3 already here, between the lines and at their intersections.

### Preview
The following are some concepts of v3, as in "between the lines", above. Extensive notes are available on request, and will be incorporated on this branch.

1. Fit. A parent category for cost and habit. The body persists in the world for a duration from birth to death. This material "event" is the body's fit in the world, a self-evident matter. 

2. Wit. A revision of word and parent category of unknown and doubt. All cognition associated with a body. Any and all actions or part of actions that are not usefully explained in physical terms. For example, Of interest are the bets that affect fit. Many bets do not. 

3. Point. A revision of content. The focus and objective of revision is to act (bet), and so the best words are the fewest needed; ideally a single referent. Maximum benefit-of-doubt assumes all content can be reduced in a way that amplifies, not decreases meaning (_reductio-ad-absurdum_).  All revisions can take the question: "What is the point?"

4. Awe. A revision of bet-alt and benefit-of-doubt, referring to the content of or pursuit of the point. All points tend to have the character of awe. The answer to all questions is the awe of the referent being investigated. Awe is the opposite of doubt (i-cause of inaction).

5. Coin and compass. A format (standard) for definition-making that is scalable, reducable, transparent and functional. Contrasted with a map (plans, examples), and IRL (self bets). Still under construction.

6. Time. Always more important to understand.
