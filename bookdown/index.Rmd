# Preface {.unnumbered}

![](G:/Dropbox/theory/website/figs/sr_gray_transp.png)

Skilled Reflection is a framework to help you make objective sense of your subjective reality.

## You

1.  You and I:
    1.  **Introduction.** This book is centered on you, the specific reader that you are aware is currently reading. I am the one writing.
    2.  **SELF.** For now, focus on applying these words to your actual [SELF][SELF], and determining exactly what or who that is.
    3.  **PRI.** Identify and own your [PRIs][Priorities] before you die.
    4.  **PPL.** You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are [PPL][PPL]. You will be too, but not yet.
    5.  **BET.** First you'll [BET][BET] about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing.
    6.  **Education.** At that point you should become [a STUDENT][Education] of better methods.
    7.  **WORDs.** As a STUDENT you'll simulate methods efficiently with [WORDs].
    8.  **Revision.** You want an answer to the same questions (below) as the rest. [Revise][Revisions] your WORDs until they are uniquely you.
    9.  **COMM.** Then you may contextualize and [communicate][Communication] who you are among PPL.
2.  Until then, you and I and they are all the same.

## Questions

3.  

    1.  You. How am I and what do I need?
    2.  Self. What must I do to have it?
    3.  Priorities. What actions maximize cake in my life?
    4.  Others. What are people?
    5.  Bet. How do I take action?
    6.  Learn. How do I figure out a better plan for my life?
    7.  Words. What are they good for?
    8.  Revision. What would my life look like on paper?
    9.  Communication. How do I relate to or help others?

## Words

4.  A book with defined terms is a book for humans.
5.  Below are key terms and their definitions, to distinguish you and me.
6.  Links to those primary contexts follow each definition.
7.  Note that, because this list is statically generated, there will be slight discrepancies with definitions in main text as sections become updated. (Last revised: v2.15).

-   MAINTENANCE is any recurring COST to neither move toward nor away from a GOAL. ([**c4.21**][WORK])\

-   A relationship (RLTP) is a GOAL about PPL. ([**c4.23**][WORK])\
-   A BET is a PLAN that leverages TIME against CHUD to facilitate GOALs or a REALITY check. ([c5.28][BET])\

-   A NOTE is a general PLAN for REVISION. (Available on request.) ([**c8.33**][NOTES and PEERs])\
-   A RECIPE is a DOC format that PRIs CONTENT (IDEAS and LINKS) over STYLE. ([**c8.37**][DOC types])\
-   COMM is the exchange of WORDS between PPL. ([**c9.45**][STYLE])\

-   PITCH is DOC STYLE for why to READ. ([**c9.65**][NORMs STYLE])

## Draft

8.  This is an early copy of Skilled Reflection, and much of it is still in development. Thank you for your patience. I welcome any and all constructive feedback ([skilledreflection\@gmail.com](mailto:skilledreflection@gmail.com){.email}). Check back later for a revised and updated version.

## Version

9.  When I first set out to write SR as a book I quickly realized a problem could hang me up forever, both simple and superficial.\

10. It is the problem of framing CONTENT (STYLE), as basic as knowing what order to present the information, so as to maximally reveal the value.

11. For illustration, this is at least the 15th unique thesis for a preface, and even as i write it I know i am woefully failing.

12. Left unaddressed, the consequence is a poverty of readership and intellectual engagement, and the inevitable death of SR.

13. In version one of this book, i deliberately set aside this problem, for the personally more desparate issue, of attempting to name and contain a system, at all. while i succeeded my decided priority, i failed the known order issue

14. I must say, as i issue the 2nd version, the consequence of the problem, has crippled me.

15. Version 2 takes the first step in remediation by streamlining all essential terms and links of the system into a shared frame, called "the garden" (introduced in version one, as concept, but not integrated in practice). Even still, in this respect version 2 is proto, at best.

16. I pen this Foreward to the 2nd Version at the advent of having spelled out critical details, via example, of the problem, namely, spelling out my process of revising *away* STYLE from CONTENT. the spelling should show you in backward fashion why and how i write the way i do.

17. I hope that for those who fell off the previous train, you find renewed interest to ride again.
