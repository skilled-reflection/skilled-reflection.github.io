Skilled Reflection is a framework to help you make objective sense of your subjective reality. 

## You and I  

- **Chapter 1: Introduction.** This book is centered on you, the specific reader that you are aware is currently reading. I am the one writing.
- **Chapter 2: SELF.** For now you need only worry about applying the words I'm saying to your actual self, and determining exactly what or who that is.
- **Chapter 3: PRI.** This is the good "worry", because the fact is you may as well [identify and own yourself before you die][Priorities].
- **Chapter 4: PPL.** You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are [PPL][PPL]. You will be too, but not yet.
- **Chapter 5: BET.** First you'll [BET][BET] about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing.
- **Chapter 6: Education.** At that point you should become [a STUDENT][Education] of better methods.
- **Chapter 7: WORDs.** As a STUDENT you'll simulate methods efficiently with [WORDs][WORDS]. 
- **Chapter 8: Revision.** We all ask, "Will I ever do it? Will I ever tell him? What next? Is this it?" [Revise][Revisions] these WORDs so they are yours.
- **Chapter 9: COMM.** Then try to [communicate][COMM] how you are and are not PPL.

Until then, the null hypothesis is that you and I and they are all the same.


## Questions  
1.  You.  How am I and what do I need?
2.	Self. What must I do to have it? 
3.  Priorities. What actions maximize cake in my life?    
4.	Others. What are people?   
5.	Bet. How do I take action?   
6.	Learn. How do I figure out a better plan for my life?    
7.	Words. What are they good for?  
8.	Revision. What would your life look like on paper? 
9.  Communication. How can we help each other?

## Index of Definitions  
This book attempts to balance convention and new ideas. They are foregrounded right here for convenience, however they will make the most sense within the narrative context of this book. Links to those primary contexts follow each definition. Keep in mind that because this list is statically generated, there will be slight discrepancies with definitions in main text as sections become updated. (Last revised: v2.15).

-	A GOAL names an ideal future outcome, and requires a PLAN to intentionally achieve it.  ([**c2.38.**][Core Concepts])  
-	A PLAN comprises WORDS that facilitate your GOAL.   ([**c2.44.**][Core Concepts])  
-	A COST is what's materially required for GOALs--an amount and kind of FORCE.  ([**c2.49.**][Core Concepts])  
-	FOOD is the necessary and sufficient material to satisfy these needs.  ([**c2.56.**][SELF])  
-	CAKE is all non-FOOD GOALs.  ([**c2.57.**][SELF])  
-	SELF is the GOAL to MAINTAIN HABIT, ideally to maximize BET outcomes.  ([**c2.58.**][SELF])  
-	HOME is the collection of tools, materials and money (which support HABITs).  ([**c2.59.**][Home])  
-	PRI is management of the GOALS in your life (and common themes therein).  ([**c3.33.**][Attention and time])  
-	PPL are different VERSIONs of each others' PRI (WRITER and READER are different, too).([**c4.1.**][PPL])  
-	TIME is the constant (or denominator) for PRI and FORCES (LIB and MEMORY).   ([**c3.38.**][Attention and time])  
-	MONEY is traded for maintenance of, or insurance for SELF and CAKE.  ([**c4.09.**][PPL])  
-  WORK is performing a specific task on a collective garden for MONEY.  ([**c4.10.**][WORK])  
-	NORMS are the "average" person's HABITs, including WORK and CHUD.  ([**c4.13.**][WORK])  
-	A FORCE is any cause of change including actions.  ([**c4.20.**][WORK])  
-	MAINTENANCE is any recurring COST to neither move toward nor away from a GOAL.   ([**c4.21.**][WORK])  
-	An ALIGNMENT is a reduced COST due to a FORCE shared between at least two GOALs.   ([**c4.22.**][WORK])  
-	A relationship (RLTP) is a GOAL about PPL.   ([**c4.23.**][WORK])  
-	A BET is a PLAN template for reconciling REALITY with CHUD, to accomplish GOALS.  ([c5.28][BET])  
-	CHUD is an acronym for assessing the reality of GOALs: COSTs, HABITs, UNKNOWNs and DOUBTs.  ([**c5.41.**][C.H.U.D.])  
-	A HABIT is the historical average of your actions and their by-products.([**c5.43.**][COSTs and HABITs])  
-	An UNKNOWN is a FORCE (especially out of your CONTROL) that makes your PLAN wrong.([**c5.44.**][UNKNOWNs and DOUBTs])  
-	A DOUBT is a source of predictable or nameable UNKNOWN, for example, "denial" or "anxiety".  ([**c5.48.**][UNKNOWNs and DOUBTs])  
-	A STUDENT is a ROLE with IDEAS from EXPERIENCE toward selfish GOALS.  ([**c6.15.**][Student])  
-	A READER hears a perspective to note their own reaction to its truth-value.  ([**c6.39.**][READ])  
-	A WRITER invests TIME and energy to map feelings onto WORDS.  ([**c6.64.**][WRITE PLAN])  
-	An INSTRUCTOR is a READING ROLE, and enforcing BETs on STUDENTs' PLANs.  ([**c6.73.**][Instructor])  
-	A WORD is a BET for simulating (direct attention to) truth (reality) or falsehood (fantasy).  ([**c7.20.**][WORD as BET])  
-  An EXAMPLE is an individual, particular event or object of reality. ([**c7.45**][EXAMPLE and IDEA])  
-  A USE-CASE is an EXAMPLE with consequence (vs HYPE). ([**c7.45**][EXAMPLE and IDEA])  
-  A HYPE (hypothetical/hype) is an EXAMPLE in-principle (vs USE-CASE).([**c7.45**][EXAMPLE and IDEA])  
-  A LINK is a WORD that relates at least two EXAMPLES, IDEAS, or describes ACTIONS, ROLES, and transformations. ([**c7.46**][EXAMPLE and IDEA])  
-  An IDEA is a set of criteria that LINKs EXAMPLEs as similar (vs not). ([**c7.46**][EXAMPLE and IDEA])  
-	A PLAN is a BET on a winning arrangement of WORDS that result in the GOAL.  ([**c7.23.**][WORD as BET])  
-	A SCIENTIST BETs new CONTENT against the UNKNOWN, evaluated for their net gain for NORMs.  ([**c7.47.**][ROLE Scientist])  
-	A RESEARCHER is a SCIENTIST WRITER, a data-collector and hypothesis tester.   ([**c7.48.**][ROLE Scientist])  
-	A SCHOLAR is a SCIENTIST READER, curating toward theory development and COMM.  ([**c7.49.**][ROLE Scientist])  
-	A LESSON is an ordered set of prompts, usually three to four, up to 60 minutes.([**c8.19.**][LESSONs])  
-	A NOTE is a general PLAN for REVISION. (Available on request.)  ([**c8.33.**][NOTES and PEERs])  
-	A RECIPE is a DOC format that PRIs CONTENT (IDEAS and LINKS) over STYLE.  ([**c8.37.**][DOC types])  
-	COMM is the exchange of WORDS between PPL.   ([**c9.45.**][STYLE])  
-	VERSIONs are variations of STYLE on a identical CONTENT, implicitly in temporal order.   ([**c9.61.**][PRIs differ])  
-	A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of the (same) final DOC.  ([**c9.62.**][PRIs differ])  
-	PITCH is DOC STYLE for why to READ.   ([**c9.65.**][NORMs STYLE])
