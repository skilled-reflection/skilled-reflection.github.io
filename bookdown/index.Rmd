# Abstract {-}

This book asks and answers a series of questions about the nature of a 
productive life and its implications, as follows:  
1. Self. What must I do (FOOD) in order to have what I want (CAKE)? Food is 
health, comprising maximum physical energy (fit) and mental energy (wit). CAKE 
is motivation, meaning and will to live (PRI).  
2.	Pri. What actions maximize cake in my life? Efficient fit and wit maximally used, 
before death (plan).  
3.	Ppl. What are people? Parallel universes dealing with identical problems, requiring words to establish connection and travel.  
4.	Bet. What actions result in CAKE? Steps taken now according to my plan (bets) 
and revision according to bet wins and failures (CHUD).  
5.	School. What now? Learn all your answers (student), along with other ppl 
(peers): go to school (IBC).   
6.	Words. What do I study? Minimize the difference between your PLAN (words) and HABITS,  and minimize BET 
failures.  
7.	Revisions. When am I done? When BETs align with PRIs and address CHUD, and as soon as possible 
(BLITZ).  
8.	Epilogue. What is wrong with this book? It is mostly about idealized 
productivity, because it is written by one instructor obsessed with discipline and 
science fiction.
