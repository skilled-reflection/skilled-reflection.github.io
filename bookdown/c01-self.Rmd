## Garden  

Visualize your life as a garden to simplify planning and action. 
Your biological needs like eating and sleeping are literal actions in this metaphor. 
Your goals are plants; the gardening process represents planning. 
Every goal you have starts as a seed in the ground. 
These goals could range from finding a partner to getting a promotion. 
Your attention and time are like water and sunlight for these seeds. Some goals are low-maintenance, like hobbies or TV shows; they grow almost effortlessly. 
Treat every goal as a plant that requires your time and resources. 
You're still a human in this garden; your needs like eating are literal actions.

## Today

Survey your garden today. 
Consider what's already planted and what you plan to add. 
Each seed represents not just a goal but the variables that come with it, like work and external circumstances. 
Prioritize: decide which goals deserve the most attention and assess synergies between them. 
Don't overthink; the garden exists for action, not contemplation. 
Focus on what needs to be cultivated today and long-term. 
Your goals must align with your capabilities and desires.
You could run out of space, time, or energy that could have been devoted to better crops;
You might get a weak yield for trying to grow something not suitable in your climate, or find you have no taste or stomach for the fruit.
In the garden metaphor, these losses are most basically understood as lost time and attention.

## Goal  

A **goal** is your vision for a future state of affairs that doesn't currently exist. 
It includes a plan to make it more likely to occur. 
It's your goal if you're committed to increasing its likelihood.
Goals vary: they can be finite or ongoing, singular or multiple, realistic or unrealistic. 
Anything that could be true but isn't now can be considered a goal.

## Plan  

A **plan** is a set of instructions aimed at improving the odds or reducing the costs of achieving a goal. 
These instructions can serve various purposes like learning, making, reminding, or changing. 
Plans come in different forms like product instructions or documents.
For instance, the manual for a lamp is a plan to ensure its optimal use and safety. 
**Costs** involved in achieving a goal can include time, energy, or resources. 
Every cost can ultimately be reduced to time. 
These costs often appear as sub-objectives within a plan, like buying a tool.

## Self  {#self-self}

The basic human needs like eating, sleeping, and hygiene are classified under the overarching goal of **self**. 
These needs are satisfied by what we call **food,** the bare essentials. 
Of course, this doesn't take the place of living your life.
The purpose of optimizing self is to maximize cake.

**Cake**, in contrast, signifies things that are fulfilling but not absolutely necessary, like ambitions or passions. 
The key is to distinguish between what is necessary (food) and what is not (cake). 
Cake will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter.
Establish routines that help you manage the essentials efficiently, like health and fitness regimes or securing physical safety through shelter. 
Mastering self means optimizing these routines for better survival.

## Home  

Your **home** represents the collection of resources and tools essential for maintaining self. 
It's organized into rooms, each designated for specific functions like a kitchen for food-related activities. 
Your home includes everything you own and serves as the basis for your habits. 
A well-maintained home is organizes the essentials (food) and maximizes quality time (cake), while a poorly managed one promotes bad habits and wastes time.
