(COMM)

## STYLE  
### Goal  

42.	RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDS is easier than RETRIEVAL from 
memory, of WORDS to write. Is- savings on revision.
43.	Only save docs that you BET will be useful enough later to save TIME, 
overall.
44.	Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE. 
This is the primary type of COMM we engage in.
45.	COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other 
examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are 
rereading, a carefully crafted party invite, or a Lease Agreement.
46.	The GOAL of COMM is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the 
inherent and practical problems that arise.

### COMM problem  
47.	Writing a WORD creates a static record of a WORD. 
48.	The problem of COMM is the difference in meaning between READER 
and WRITER of the same WORD. 
49.	Even if you wrote the WORD, your later SELF may read a different 
meaning for that WORD. 
50.	No person is identical with a future or past SELF, with any other 
person, and all of these relationships are in part UNKNOWN. 
51.	GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues. 
52.	BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the COST of clarity and 
honesty.
53.	PPL vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can vary in 
    1.	precise understanding of meanings.
    2.	TRUST (usually WRITER more than READER). 
54.	The real world is particular; each experience is an EXAMPLE. 
55.	A WORD describes a set of similar experiences. 
     1.	WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of the real world.
     2.	A WORD's definition is a generalization. 
56.	As such, WORDS are 
     1.	less precise than reality.
     2.	better designed to hypothesize and predict.
57.	To improve COMM, study the difference between CONTENT and STYLE.

### PRIs differ

58.	PRIS between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
59.	Difference in PRIS alter CONTENT of ideas.
60.	Good STYLE is change in WORDS to minimize change in ideas between 
READER and WRITER.
61.	Versions describe identical CONTENT with difference in STYLE between them. 
62.	A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of the (same) final DOC.
63.	For example, you today vs you in five years.

### NORMs STYLE  

64.	COMM NORMs assume READING and WRITING have no intrinsic GOALS. 
65.	A DOC's arguments for why to READ it are a STYLE called PITCH. 
66.	Pitch can be accomplished, for example, by
    1.	stroking the ego and intelligence of the reader.
    2.	framing attacks as agreeable observations.
67.	The maximum common SELF-PRIS across PPL are the optimal 
arguments for PITCH. E-FOOD vs. CAKE.
68.	BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth, a form of bad STYLE.
69. For example, consider the GOAL of describing the properties of __apples __ with the purpose of selling them:  
    1. CONTENT: __Apples are healthy but sugary. __  
    2. STYLE: __Apples are tasty and nutritious. __  
    3. BRAND: __Apples are healthy.__  
70.	PPL who do not distinguish FOOD from CAKE will be persuaded by BRAND more than PITCH.

## Library

### Def  
71.	LIB is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you WRITE, SAVE, 
and READ, by organizing it for best application, and providing feedback 
to help your future decisions to WRITE, SAVE, and READ.
72.	The scope of LIB is the collection of your WORDS over a lifetime. 
73.	is post-WRITING cache to facilitate future production.
74.	LIB is to docs as HOME is to possessions.

### LIB as PRI  

75.	LIB aims to maximize the CAKE of WORDS you save, and ideally, 
reduce future efforts to PLAN and accomplish PRIS, through making 
the best of your thoughts easy to find.
76.	A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation, none of which 
helped PLANS.
77.	A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.
78.	Library = sum (GOALS + PLANS) / 1
79.	For learning what you don't know you don't know.
80.	Potential risks include 
80.1.	writing, saving, and finding bad docs. 
80.2.	failure to save or find good docs.
81.	Studying links will improve ideas.
82.	PLANS, and anything else you write down, should be part of a PRI.
83.	Facilitate RETRIEVAL: 
83.1.	Index (list) docs worth rereading. 
83.2.	Assign a number that indicates its relative importance (abs or 
relative weight). 
83.3.	Add tags and metadata for easier sorting.
83.4.	Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s). Record and study LIB 
RETRIEVAL patterns.
84.	Note the TIME and date now, as you did in the introduction.
Graduate
85.	This is the end of the book. 
86.	Put it in your library.
87.	Now return to your garden and WORK on your PRIS.

### Reference system  
88. Well, what LIB would be complete without
89. a reference index? 
90. The equivalent of the Dewey system
91. mine is a reference of space-and-time:
91.1. Space: this book's chapter and line numbering, and
91.2. Time: v2.14 the current book version.
92. For example, a document that elaborates about trump would begin titled "c4.23 v2.14".
93. In version 2.14 of SR, 4 is the chapter PPL, and number 23 is the definition of RLTP. Trump, the article topic, is an example.
94. this is the header format for any subsequent document of an idea I write.

### The Answerword

95. The complete set of PPL's LIBs is sufficiently exhaustive to describe all that matters in each and all lives. 
96. The efficiently compressed content of this LIB produces a distribution of variation along a median LIB. 
97. This is the content of the next book, "Answerword."
98. In that book, STYLE is any further optimization to maximize learning.

99. Book 3, "Afterword", is the DARPA for thought when the Answerword is muscle-memory.

## Outtakes


### Your Calling, Part II 

4.	Tell me the missing chapter
that gives peace instead of regimen,
so that I may find mine.

###  Instructor 0 to Instructors (SR.v1)

5.	Listen up, you vibrating sacks of meat.
6.	A teacher and student conspire in a radical co-dependency, mutually betting on 
the student's ability. 
7.	It is my job to sniff out why on Earth you are interested in this.
8.	You are crazy for wanting to be a teacher. 
9.	Until you are, you have only one thing to teach: 
10.	You must teach me to believe you.
11.	You will do everything to put the truth in front of me.
12.	If I find out you withhold the truth, I will punish you with it.
13.	You are a teacher when your students pay for both your lost TIME with BET winnings.
