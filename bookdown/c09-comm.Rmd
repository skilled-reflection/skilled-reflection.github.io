(COMM)




## intro
1. Consider you meet someone in the woods, and have only 1m (approx. 250w) to say the most essential thing. 

2. When you communicate (COMM), skip SELF and talk PRI. Convey the greatest amount of relevant information with greatest likelihood of understanding or convincing.

3. PRI-COMM is the difference between your and NORM-PRI, especially that what your FOOD and CAKE are and why.
4. Say:
    1. properties of the answer, not knowing it,
    2. an answer for purposes of improving on it.

5. These properties are the properties of [SR][Skilled Reflection]: 
    1. comparable constraints to establish a reliable subjective experience.
    2. until we have a measurable SELF and variation, share the SELF that is CAKE, in 250w.

## basic problem and plan  
init 440 words, 2021-05-20-2350

communication happens from one being to another,
like the vervet screech that specifically means, "snake".
the function is to direct attention to a circumstance of high importance: 
sharing information.

while the vervet makes or hears calls about threats of immediate, nearby importance,
the breadth of human communication can direct attention to circumstances of
distant places and times. 
- this is an echo of the breadth of attention and information humans engage.
for some reason entangled between information, sharing it, there is subjectivity of importance.
the consequence is ambiguity in the value of a communicative act.

### S0-PRI  
1. My PRI: To preserve COMM's inherent value, that humans have information valuable to a listener, which they want to share.

2. I mainly encourage people who speak, because wanting to share is more evident than the value itself. To me this is the closest to social value- and thus material benefit to the other side of my interest (next).
3. The potentiality of making a dream of a better language, become real.
Where better is either easier to use given the same benefit or clearer to benefit from given the same difficulty to say and understand it.
4. such ease invites noticing and attending to yet better information, and as a result, lives lived longer and more stress free of snakes (i-buddhist rope-v-snake).

5. i want you to share this value, but i don't believe you can yet, 
6. so let us return to how to better use our existing communication:
    1. know what you're attending to, that you intend to communicate.
    2. when communicating, make explicit the pre-existing assumption your information improves on. this is your call of "snake", relative to the absence of one, implying the lack of snakes in the grass. 
    3. aim to approximate this level of value with the utterance, and especially published recording of, your words. 
with enough people, hopefully, we'll test the potential to intentionally grow language.

7. I bet these words are but the first of mine valuable to the systematic improvement of sharing information.

## ask and tell
1. comm non-atomic links with sayings - quotes.

a wants what b knows

lang coordinates.

naturally, all referents observable in the world.

it struggles at instances of the qualia problem.

### aware
when 
1-a does not have internal_state_1 (is1) and
2-b has is1,

what lets A know 
Q1- 2
Q2- b knows 1 and 2

what is style( B -> A )?
- reality-A =? reality-B
(as it currently reads, this question is *actually* how do we, C, know that... Q1 and Q2. better to reframe as A == I, writer, and B == you, reader; or similar)

### agency
B knows his own example of
PLAN, what changed 1 to 2.

can B's PLAN be
Q3-used by A?
Q4-explainable to A (given 1)?
and worthwhile (faster than A, otherwise)?

### communicable
what lets
- A and B trust B can provide PLAN for A to move from 1 to 2?

intuition says what 
expert needs to say to 
novices is
what to do.

contrast this with
for how long.

the raw measure of efficacy is as follows:

instr-recipe 
10m blitz conditions
1-emphasize ingredient and task list
2-emphasize quantity, size, duration of task, focus distribution

# claim
1-misleading shape-bias; "false cognates"
novice over fixates on what is distinct (shape bias).
expert only is aware that some distinct things are as easy as familiar,
whereas some almost-familiar shapes might be unusually difficult.
- false cognates.

2-misleading intersection
- false familiarity based on object and verb; combo is unfamiliar.

## STYLE  
### Goal  

2.	RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDS is easier than RETRIEVAL from 
memory, of WORDS to write. Is- savings on revision.
3.	Only save docs that you BET will be useful enough later to save TIME, 
overall.
4.	Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE. 
This is the primary type of COMM we engage in.
5.	COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other 
examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are 
rereading, a carefully crafted party invite, or a Lease Agreement.
6.	The GOAL of COMM is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the inherent and practical problems that arise.

### COMM problem  
7.	Writing a WORD creates a static record of a WORD. 
8.	No person is identical with a future or past SELF, with any other 
person, and all of these relationships are in part UNKNOWN. ([c4.1][PPL])
9. The problem of COMM is the difference in meaning between READER 
and WRITER of the same WORD. 
10.	Even if you wrote the WORD, your later SELF may read a different 
meaning for that WORD. 
11.	GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues. 
12.	BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the COST of clarity and 
honesty.
13.	PPL vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can vary in 
    1.	precise understanding of meanings.
    2.	TRUST (usually WRITER more than READER). 
14.	The real world is particular; each experience is an EXAMPLE. 
15.	A WORD describes a set of similar experiences. 
     1.	WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of the real world.
     2.	A WORD's definition is a generalization. 
16.	As such, WORDS are 
     1.	less precise than reality.
     2.	better designed to hypothesize and predict.
17.	To improve COMM, study the difference between CONTENT and STYLE.

### PRIs differ

18.	PRIS between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
19.	Difference in PRIS alter CONTENT of ideas.
20.	Good STYLE is change in WORDS to minimize change in ideas between 
READER and WRITER.
21.	Versions describe identical CONTENT with difference in STYLE between them. 
22.	A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of the (same) final DOC.
23.	For example, you today vs you in five years.

### NORMs STYLE  

24.	COMM NORMs assume READING and WRITING have no intrinsic GOALS. 
25.	A DOC's arguments for why to READ it are a STYLE called PITCH. 
26.	Pitch can be accomplished, for example, by
    1.	stroking the ego and intelligence of the reader.
    2.	framing attacks as agreeable observations.
27.	The maximum common SELF-PRIS across PPL are the optimal 
arguments for PITCH. E-FOOD vs. CAKE.
28.	BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth, a form of bad STYLE.
29. For example, consider the GOAL of describing the properties of __apples __ with the purpose of selling them:  
    1. CONTENT: __Apples are healthy but sugary. __  
    2. STYLE: __Apples are tasty and nutritious. __  
    3. BRAND: __Apples are healthy.__  
30.	PPL who do not distinguish FOOD from CAKE will be persuaded by BRAND more than PITCH.

## Library

### Def  
31.	LIB is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you WRITE, SAVE, 
and READ, by organizing it for best application, and providing feedback 
to help your future decisions to WRITE, SAVE, and READ.
32.	The scope of LIB is the collection of your WORDS over a lifetime. 
33.	is post-WRITING cache to facilitate future production.
34.	LIB is to docs as HOME is to possessions.

### LIB as PRI  

35.	LIB aims to maximize the CAKE of WORDS you save, and ideally, 
reduce future efforts to PLAN and accomplish PRIS, through making 
the best of your thoughts easy to find.
36.	A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation, none of which 
helped PLANS.
37.	A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.
38.	Library = sum (GOALS + PLANS) / 1
39.	For learning what you don't know you don't know.
40.	Potential risks include 
40.1.	writing, saving, and finding bad docs. 
40.2.	failure to save or find good docs.
41.	Studying links will improve ideas.
42.	PLANS, and anything else you write down, should be part of a PRI.
43.	Facilitate RETRIEVAL: 
    1.	Index (list) docs worth rereading. 
    2.	Assign a number that indicates its relative importance (abs or 
relative weight). 
    3.	Add tags and metadata for easier sorting.
    4.	Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s). Record and study LIB RETRIEVAL patterns.
44.	Note the TIME and date now, as you did in the introduction.
Graduate
45.	This is the end of the book. 
46.	Put it in your library.
47.	Now return to your garden and WORK on your PRIS.

### Reference system  
51.1. Space: this book's chapter and line numbering, and
51.2. Time: v2.14 the current book version.
52. For example, a document that elaborates about trump would begin titled "c4.23 v2.14".
53. In version 2.14 of SR, 4 is the chapter PPL, and number 23 is the definition of RLTP. Trump, the article topic, is an example.
54. this is the header format for any subsequent document of an idea I write.

### The Answerword

55. The complete set of PPL's LIBs is sufficiently exhaustive to describe all that matters in each and all lives. 
56. The efficiently compressed content of this LIB produces a distribution of variation along a median LIB. 
57. This is the content of the next book, "Answerword."
58. In that book, STYLE is any further optimization to maximize learning.

59. Book 3, "Afterword", is the DARPA for thought when the Answerword is muscle-memory.


## Outtakes
60. Suppose you don't share the same language. What conventions of gesture, an international gesture meaning, might we have?
    1. An object pointed to means: There it is; It is/will be mine; I want it; You want it;  

## Your Calling, Part II 

61.	Tell me the missing chapter
that gives peace instead of regimen,
so that I may find mine.
