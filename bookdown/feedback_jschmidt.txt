Ch 2:


Ch 3:
c3.4 - capitalize second “goals”?

c3.6 - not necessarily? (some people working too much during the week and needing to catch up on weekend)

c3.14 - this feels like a more subjective opinion

c3.19 - haven’t introduced “PPL” yet so using it without defining it leaves it open to interpretation

c3.30 - why is “Attention and time” at the end?

c3.33 - haven’t defined “PRI” yet

c3.35.2 - what is “CHUD”?
c3.35.3 - are “PRIS” dif from “PRIs” (plural PRI)?
c3.35.4 - garden path “group GOALS by…”’i read as shared goals of a group of people, spent a few tries re-reading before i understood sentence meaning; where is fig 4?
c3.35.5 - define “ALIGN”?
c3.35.6 - what does adopting GOALS to REALITY mean? (define “REALITY”?)

c3.37 - capitalizing g in Grouping, but not the whole word means what? (what category in your semantic framework?); why is fig 3 after fig 4 in this flow and where is it?

c3.38 - define new capitalized words?; why isn’t “reality” capitalized here like before?; define “LINK”

c3.39 - where did tomatoes and carrots come from? (is this supposed to just bring the reader back to the garden metaphor?)

c3.41 - “these” meaning what?

c3.42 - no feedback, i just LOVE this

c3.43 - capitalize “calling”?

c3.44 - define DOUBTS

c3.46 - “student” here feels weird to me (introduces roles and power dynamics between author and reader, rather than a more objective sharing of information from an experienced guide)

c3.47 - “this book” instead of “my book”? (more about universal phenomena spoken for as itself, less about more subjective view from an individual (the author))


Ch 4:
(why the authors note? this chapter is cohesive and powerful!)
confusing numbering; 46, 47 (48-53 pointed out), 1-53;

c4.1 - PPL in parentheses right after “PPL”? ; not super clear right away that it means “people” (like how it is super clear in c4.23 with relationships)

c4.32 - always as a rule? what if they are bad for PRIs?

c4.48 - people or PPL?

c4.49-53 - this all feels like one idea; why did you stop using the code/capitalized words?


Ch 5:
c5.2 - has BET been defined yet?

c5.8 - “Betting” dif from”BETTING”?

c5.9 - not feedback but a quote i think you’ll like (i don’t know who said it) - “on the day you die, the you that you have become will meet the you that you could have become”

c5.23 - ah so BET is defined here; i still don’t know what a CHUD is

c5.24 - how does upper case BET relate to lower case Betting?

c5.28 - CHUD v C.H.U.D?

c5.41 - ah here CHUD is, it is a little confusing early on not knowing what i means until now but might be enriching for the reader on subsequent read throughs

c5.48 - great definition but it might be helpful to read this earlier (before DOUBTs are used so much)


Ch 6:
c6.15 - had EXPERIENCE been defined yet? 

c6.17 - is this STUDENT different from c.6.15’s student?; what does “admits not knowing but capable” mean? is it that thru admit that they don’t know everything but are capable of improving?

c6.18-20 - is this student different from earlier STUDENTs? 

c6.24 - define WORK?

c6.60-2 - this is so good

c6.63 - this beginning doesn’t really make sense to me (the punctuation)

c6.68 - what do those three words at the end mean?

c6.69 - what are tag WORDs?

c6.70 - what is COMM-CONTENT?

c6.71 - what is LIB-PPL?; what is ROT?

c6.73 - is this READ(S or s?) different from earlier “read”ing?


Ch 7:
c7.7 - not sure i understand how BET comes in here

c7.16 - What does “Kinda and uses” mean?

c7.26 - what’s LIB?

c7.28 - is level a source? (if so why use one here and no where else? or why use any at all?)

c7.45 - should the second “example” be capitalized like the first one?; definitions of USE-CASE and HYPE?

c7.47 - define MEMES and CONTENT?

c7.49 - has COMM been defined yet? (i just can’t remember)


Ch 8:
c8.1 - what does [50,51,56,57] mean?

c8.4 - has CONTEXT been defined?

c8.5 - has LIST been defined?

c8.7 - does ‘doc’ here mean document?

c8.25 - “Revising” rather than “revise” sound smoother?

c8.28-29 - capitalized REVISIONS or is this not = to your coded words?

c8.36 - is RECIPE dif from Recipe (in c.7.35?)

c8.43 - last sentence doesn’t make sense to me

c8.38 - was SELF-MAINTENENCE defined?

c8.44 - is this “DOC” dif from c.8.39’s “docs”

c8.51 - has GOOD been defined?

c8.52 - has BAD been defined?

c8.53 - has TRUST been defined?


c8.57 - is this “ STYLE” dif from c.7.43’s “style”? if it is STYLE then shouldn’t it be defined earlier? it is sorta defined in c.8.60


c8.64 - it’s unclear to me what COMM-PPL means


c8.66 - is this Pitch dif from c8.65’s PITCH


c8.67 - i don’t understand this one (it’s just a little too abstract)


c8.71 - LIB has been used before and i had no idea what it meant until now, marine define unit earlier?


c8.73 - the start of this is feels like it’s missing something and doesn’t make sense because of it


c8.74 - docs or DOCs


c8.78 - Library or LIB? ; this equation doesn’t make sense to me


c8.80 - docs (as written) or DOCs (as used previously)?


c8.81 - links (as written) or LINKs (as used previously)?


c8.83.1 - list (as written) or LIST (as used previously)

c8.83 - does abs mean absolute here?

c8.87 - should “garden” be a coded word (GARDEN) representing its place in your framework?
