### academic
Skilled reflection is a framework for reflection-based writing, which aims to foreground cognitive stress and cognitive dissonance for the purpose of clarifying individual goals and goal planning. These outcomes are assumed to be a product of a cluster of features:

- multiple, ordered prompts. Variation in prompt focus offers opportunities to recognize complexity, and potential incompatibilities in the conception and application of personal goals. Later prompts are designed explicitly to bring focus to reconciling challenges, especially between conception and realization of goal plans. That is, we think differently than how we act.

- word and time limits. The joint combination of which imposes expectations of cognitive effort, and protects against distraction from the writing task.
includes a cluster of features which can be summarized by the following objective. 

### Dear social science,

A letter is an optimal form for what I want to convey,
because it makes clear the audience.
Though none are my audience proper, all can see which way I'm looking.

I've built a kind of form with many default values and
instructions for describing individual experience.

This is a standardization with the goal of resolving many of the problems of communication we take for granted.

We call it subjectivity, and celebrate it, but subjectivity is also the name for the most crippling social problems, too.

### q-student is not a learner 
classrooms fail to educate when a student doesn't know/have a purpose to learn.

the student is learning for 
- at best: unknown purposes
- at worst: personally undesired purposes (i.e. resistance)

#### ans  
ibc argues that teaching ought to occur only when the learner is between
- known purposes
- desired purposes

a document formalizes this relationship

amount of learning is proportional to the desirability and known quantity of *purpose* of new material.

### q-I don't need SR
here is the best reason for 
my to not be here:
i already know exactly what 
i want out of life,
and how to get it.
in fact, i have it already.
i've had it forever.

#### ans
well - that's right.
it's true for me and everyone else.
only tricky part is i'm not sure what *it's* called.

money, love, fame, peace.
the right friends, knowledge. sanity.

but if the following is true
you're not a student:

i honestly don't want to 
- think about myself.
- consider what i could be doing better.

### q-unrealized private welfare  
technology has boomed, and implications are still rippling outward. a late bloomer is the private benefit.

object of study and insight is to serve the elite.

great reveal of ivory tower:
- "humans do not behave rationally",

#### ans
market of popular thought.
- generation-1-e-Wikipedia

ibc is the call to action in response.
- weaponizes insights from various disciplines.

### lang is inefficient  
language is inefficient
- users are imprecise and irrational
consequence-we do not
- know 
  - each other
  - what there is to know about quality of living.
- efficiently transmit, share information; learn
  - the longform is absurd
  
#### ans
minimize steps for accomplishing shared reference
use plain language
find intuitive routes to understanding.
- by-product: learning and education.


## take up time  
why am i taking up your time. 
i’m not. 
i’m not even here. 
Well I want to be an idea in your head 
instead of some imposing stranger. 
So for the next 5 minutes, 
if it helps you be more comfortable 
when you think, 
feel free to close your eyes.
the idea that’s popping into your head, 
is that a journal club might help you 
get more time in your life back. 

## what is SR? 

Skilled Reflection is a journal club, 
but it’s different from journaling 
- about your day or 
- thoughts, we’re journaling about the link between 
- personal aspirations, and 
- helpful actions that we’re ready to take. 
All it takes is a mindset 
for focusing on yourself. 


## for everyone  

There are two kinds of people in this room. 
To the first kind of person, 
Skilled Reflection is the place 
where you are encouraged
to embrace yourself, 
- privately, honestly, and seriously; 
to critically reflect, 
and by doing so, 
strengthen your grounding in this world.
To the second kind of person, 
Skilled Reflection is 
- how spend begin to your time 
- more effectively, and 
- get more of it, regardless of 
- what effective means, or 
- what you’d do with more time. 

## is this for you ? 
All of you are in different places in your lives. 
Think deeply about yourself, and 
be honest is an intimidating thing. 
- you are scared to do it all the time, for a million reasons. 
- it’s a personal decision, commitment and risk.
Now you’re asking yourself: 
Is there a better version of me? 
Am I capable of moving toward it? 
(trust) Am I ready to? (motivation)
These answers should give you an idea of whether 
Skilled Reflection will be for you. 
And that’s the last of the intrusive thoughts, 
for now. 
You can open your eyes. 
If you happened to say yes to those questions, 
however, 
Consider taking the first step, 
by coming to our first Skilled Reflection Session, 
next tuesday.


### afterword  
there are two types of people in you,
the dumb one and the smart one.
you have two types of ears,
a fearful one and a curious one.
