1.  **SELF.** For now, focus on applying these words to your actual [SELF][SELF], and determining exactly what or who that is.
2.  **PRI.** Identify and own your [PRIs][Priorities] before you die.
3.  **PPL.** You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are [PPL][PPL]. You will be too, but not yet.
4.  **BET.** First you'll [BET][BET] about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing.
5.  **Education.** At that point you should become [a STUDENT][Education] of better methods.
6.  **WORDs.** As a STUDENT you'll simulate methods efficiently with [WORDs].
7.  **Revision.** You want an answer to the same questions (below) as the rest. [Revise][Revisions] your WORDs until they are uniquely you.

\hypertarget{draft}{%
\section{Draft}\label{draft}}

This is an early copy of Skilled Reflection, and much of it is still in development. Thank you for your patience. I welcome any and all constructive feedback (\href{mailto:skilledreflection@gmail.com}{\nolinkurl{skilledreflection@gmail.com}}). Check back later for a revised and updated version.

\hypertarget{version}{%
\section{Version}\label{version}}

When I first set out to write SR as a book I quickly realized a problem could hang me up forever, both simple and superficial.
It is the problem of what order to present the information, so that its truth is easily learnable and most evident.
In Version 1 of this book, I deliberately set aside this problem, in order to name and contain the system of thinking.
Version 2 takes the first step in remediation by streamlining all essential terms and links of the system into a shared frame, called ``the Garden'' (introduced in version one). Even still, in this respect version 2 is only a working prototype at best.
I pen this Forward at the advent of betting my life on Version 3 (2022-08-30). I cannot promise if / when it will surface, but if you are curious, do not wait. You can find Version 3 already here, between the lines and at their intersections.

\hypertarget{dear}{%
\section{Dear}\label{dear}}

Dear, read this book because you're ready to.
You are going to die someday. This book is for you if there is something in the meantime worth maximizing.
Please engage your life. This book is meant to help you understand and take action, starting right now.

\hypertarget{test}{%
\section{Test}\label{test}}

Please get a pencil and note the date and time, right now: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
The words in this book are meaningful only when you apply them to your life.
If you wrote the date and time as requested, you have proven enough to yourself that you are open to trying new ideas. you are prepared to grow and continue reading.
If you left the line blank, you might tell yourself you are open to new ideas. You will be right when you complete the task.
Either write the time above or stop reading, and take a better action to improve your life, right now.

\hypertarget{game}{%
\section{Game}\label{game}}

From now on, every word you (or i) say is a plan for action.
That plan is meaningless until you take that action, whether good or bad.
Therefore, spend less time worrying about why this word or that plan.
Spend more time deciding which will be the next moves in your game of life.\\
Sincerely, An0ther

\hypertarget{camp}{%
\section{Camp}\label{camp}}

This book presents plain and obvious facts of life as the antidote to modern complexities of life.
In most cases, the relevance can be seen more clearly if you \protect\hyperlink{words}{simulate} the experience being described, or explicitly consider it in your life (see \protect\hyperlink{word-read}{role of reading}). Let's practice. For example, consider going on a camping trip.

\begin{verbatim}
1. Look at the clock and determine when you should expect to arrive.
2. Whatever that time, when you arrive, you will likely be over- prepared, under-prepared, or 1-3 hours late.
3. or you might be an experienced camper.
\end{verbatim}

Either way, this is your only shot at a lifelong camping trip for yourself on earth.
My guess is you are very likely late to your own life.
The games we (people, scientists, etc.) play to explain away this fact, end with this book.

\hypertarget{intro-pitch}{%
\section{Pitch}\label{intro-pitch}}

To understand this book will require you to find and repair the disconnect between your mind's image of time, and the one you are physically bound to.
If you fail, you will die in two worlds, the world you imagine you could have lived, and the one you did.
You, however, would like to ace your own life.
Part one of this book (the garden) gives you all the general answers, and the basic tools for finding the answers particular to you.
Part two teaches you how to (re)build your tools.

\hypertarget{eat}{%
\section{Eat}\label{eat}}

The one thing up to you that this book will not do is draw the line between need and want.
In this book, food refers to needs and cake refers to wants.
You must practice discerning which is which for you, until it is second-nature.
Then, all decisions can be made as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
1. If hungry, eat food.
2. If full, prepare and pack food.
3. If time, eat or prepare cake.
\end{verbatim}

Beware of thinking cake is food.

\hypertarget{homeless}{%
\section{Homeless}\label{homeless}}

Do, don't think. likely at this point you have slipped into thinking this is a book discussing a philosophy, but it is not.
The difference between food and cake is not understood and solved as a mental exercise in your living room, but by experiencing and paying attention.
What's more, if you don't have a living room, cake can be painfully obvious. be homeless.

\hypertarget{food}{%
\section{Food}\label{food}}

The odds are you aren't homeless and will avoid becoming so.
As with any hypothetical, practice finding the nearest analogous, personally meaningful experience:

\begin{verbatim}
1. You couldn't find your car in the middle of winter.
2. You went camping without waterproof gear and it rained.
3. For weeks your shower only produced ice cold water.
4. You were isolated in your house for most of two years during a global pandemic.  
\end{verbatim}

Whatever the circumstance, your habit protests for a change in plans.
However small or profound the suffering or its threat:

\begin{verbatim}
1. There is initially terror, frustration and suffering.
2. Enduring, what you consider suffering will change.
3. You will need far less food than you thought, giving more time and quality cake you really desire.   
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{intro-plan}{%
\section{Plan}\label{intro-plan}}

In the first half of this book is a conceptual metaphor described as a garden.
It is a mental model of reality, designed to bring clarity.
Your garden is your goals put on key ideas of this book.
You need the garden to combat the idealistic side of your mind, inclined to ignore time and your self, which sets you up for failure and suffering.
The second half of these chapters elaborates explicitly on the key ideas.

\hypertarget{intro-lessons}{%
\section{Lessons}\label{intro-lessons}}

At the end of the book are a series of \protect\hyperlink{zero-or-one}{lessons} for identifying what matters, what's wrong, and what's next in your life.
They are designed to be useful at any time, and especially repeatedly.
Don't wait to finish the book to try one out, because they are pivotal to skilled reflection.
However, don't do too many of them before at least reading the relevant section that explains the format of {[}skilled reflection{]}{[}skilled reflection{]}.

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\section{Definitions}\label{definitions}}

Pay attention to how words are defined, as it often differs slightly from conventional use.
For example, ``work'' is an idea referring to ``careers'', but not `yard work'.
These nuances are the result of careful decisions about the food and cake of the ideas.
You can find a list of the key ideas in the {[}index of definitions{]}{[}index of definitions{]}.
Each chapter deals with a distinct perspective or dimension of life and the goals related to it. what is said is what can be simplified for generalizable guidance.
Like food vs cake, the habits relevant to your goals can be closer to food, or excessive like cake.
In the context of definitions, they will be referred to instead, as ``good'' and ``bad'' (for example, {[}c9.60{]}{[}pris differ{]}).

\hypertarget{garden}{%
\section{Garden}\label{garden}}

Imagine your life takes place in a garden.
Visualizing your life as a garden allows you to ground actions and plans.
The mind analyzes well with visual space.
In this garden we'll consider all your biological needs -- eating, sleeping especially -- as literal.
Your plants are goals, and gardening is your plan.
Food and cake exists in the form of fruit from plants.
Whatever it takes to obtain your cake you can consider as an act of gardening.
Every one of your life ambitions, goals, is buried in the ground as seeds.
Finding a life partner, acquiring a car or promotion, or resolving a conflict with your childhood friend are all matters spread across the dirt in need of water, sunlight, and--most important--your time.
Other goals, like your favorite hobbies, or tv shows, take little work and grow almost anywhere.
Whether they are dear to you or weeds, if they take your time, they are plants in your garden.
Except that they start as seeds.
And what do you do with seeds to make plants? You garden, dear human, you garden.
All actions toward a plant are according to plan.
All actions toward your self are to be considered literal in the garden metaphor.
For example, if you need to eat, or go to the bathroom, you physically go to the place and literally do the deed.
(There will be no pooping on plants, or a pooping plant in this garden.)
Thus, in the garden you are still a normal human bound to a normal space and time, capable of: acting according to bodily need, moving about space, and gardening.

\hypertarget{today}{%
\section{Today}\label{today}}

Today, you are looking out across the entire garden.
What has already been planted? What will you add and how much time will you devote to those goals?
Every seed you plant -- even an abstract one like passing a course or making a friend-- implies things in and out of your control like work and weather, or beyond your awareness, like what your boss loses sleep over.
Meditate on the final products of your garden.
Is there a more important plant that deserves your time today?
Meditate on the priorities of your work. do two plants grow better when together?
Make a quick and accurate assessment, but don't sit here all morning thinking about it.
A garden is for working in, to get the food and cake you need.
What do you need to cultivate, today?
What do you want to cultivate in this life?
First, you want what your body and mind best respond to. many of these seeds will be obvious.
It is up to you how curious you are for what better life is possible.
The day is too short to try everything, and many things are not worth trying.
There is not always harm to planting something that does not grow, but sometimes there is.
You could run out of space, time, or energy that could have been devoted to better crops;
You might get a weak yield for trying to grow something not suitable in your climate, or
Find you have no taste or stomach for the fruit.
In the garden, the costs of goals are grounded in their most basic sense: time and attention.

\hypertarget{goal}{%
\section{Goal}\label{goal}}

The following are core concepts for application beyond the garden.
A goal names an ideal future reality, comprises a plan to increase its likelihood, associated with chud.
These three things encompass all cognitive activity related to reality.
Call anything that could be true, but isn't right now, a goal, and any effort in support of making it true a plan.
It is \emph{your} goal if you aim to increase its probability of being true.
A goal can be finite or persistent, singular or recurring, or realistic or not.

\hypertarget{plan}{%
\section{Plan}\label{plan}}

If you will need to do something before it is in your hand, it requires a plan.
A plan is any combination of words where the writing or reading of them aims to improve the chance or decrease the cost of achieving your goal.
Most plans are instructions (instr) for learning, making, changing, reminding. product instr are a plan to maximize satisfaction and minimize liability. for example, lamp instr will likely suggest not to put it in water.
``A doc is a plan for goals to complete a linguistic product . example docs include a resume or epitaph on a tombstone.''
``Lessons are a plan template for thinking. . read and complete lesson steps in order.''
Tools are physical or mental objects that help you accomplish your goal.
What is materially required--muscle energy, cash, brain power--is cost.
All costs can be reduced to time.
Cost is any action that has a direct exchange.
Costs often are secondary objectives within a plan.
For example, you might buy a tool (cost).

\hypertarget{self-self}{%
\section{Self}\label{self-self}}

Every day, as a human, you spend time and attention just meeting basic needs: eating, drinking, pooping, and sleeping.
These actions are subgoals of maintaining self, the category of basic human goals.
Food is the necessary and sufficient material to satisfy these needs.
Cake is anything (else) fulfilling, that you are inclined to pursue, including the reason for living.
The goals of self are what's necessary and sufficient to obtain and manage food and maximize bet outcomes (\protect\hyperlink{word-bet}{c5.28}). mind, healthy relationships.
Separate food from cake.
Be careful not to mislabel cake as food. cake may appear sufficient but ask yourself if it is necessary.
Build routines for health and fitness, physical safety (shelter), a sound
Master the self (survive well).

\hypertarget{home}{%
\section{Home}\label{home}}

Home is the collection of materials and tools needed for self.
Within a home related actions are grouped into rooms.
For example, a kitchen, is for eating, storing, preparing and disposing of food.
Home also includes all physical material and resources you own, including money, and environment and basis for habits.
A good home is clean and aligned for food.
A bad home facilitates bad habits and takes more time to maintain.
All your life can be very well characterized by a series of purely numerical data:
Event timestamps associated with a location.
The average movement over time, consider as habits.
The average location is home.

\hypertarget{priorities}{%
\chapter{Priorities}\label{priorities}}

\hypertarget{calling}{%
\section{Calling}\label{calling}}

Your calling--your highest priority--is yours to name.
If you overcome your doubts and see reality plainly, you will want peace.
But we all have doubts, so you want some form of dignity and affirmation.
Tell me your calling, student, and subtracting from peace, i'll tell you your doubts.
On mastering my book your life will be regimented to afford your calling.

Tell me the missing chapter that gives peace instead of regimen, so that i may find mine.

\hypertarget{cakes}{%
\section{Cakes}\label{cakes}}

In your garden you have the seeds and sprouts of the best you could want, and the most important of what you need.
There are two important things to keep in mind, however clear things may seem right now.
The first is to always leave room for your goals to change, if and when you achieve them. think of what you can grow from the seeds of the best apple in your crop.
The second is that much of what you could achieve, you won't, before the day is over, nor before you die.
Before there was a garden, you lived as if you wouldn't die. at least some of your goals assume \emph{tomorrow} is a good time to start.
I did, at least. the list of my goals grew like a wild vine and i found myself overwhelmed by what else i wanted, and yet an inability to equalize various
The very difficult task of your priorities, at their core, is to establish the optimal intersection of finite time and infinite, ever-changing desire.
For example, sleep. about 4 hours daily is a vital priority for everyone (food), but sleeping in on the weekends is usually not (cake).
In your garden, you are limited in what you can do in one day, and in one lifetime.
Even if you build machines to work fields that stretch out to the horizons,
You can only eat so much in a day and a lifetime.
How do you most want to spend your time?
If your goal is to obtain something you do not yet have and have never tasted, be careful. it may not satisfy you how you imagine.
Suppose your goal takes 300 hours of labor.
You might spend 10 years accruing the time on task, or immerse yourself and achieve your goal in under 1 year.
Any true goal has a specific optimal deadline.
Today, you grow the best apple you can,
Yet having tasted it, you might discover a more refined goal is closer to your heart.
Whether this apple is food or cake, the more you align with yourself, the more you will see your goals differently than you first conceived of them.
Leave time in your life to achieve the next goal.

\hypertarget{death}{%
\section{Death}\label{death}}

Many ppl believe in seeds with special powers, like true love, or winning the lottery.
One seed grows the duration of your life, which you rarely notice but are often aware of.
When you eat it, the sun sets for the last time and you bite the dust. it happens to all of us.
Think about this, but don't dwell on it.

\hypertarget{sick}{%
\section{Sick}\label{sick}}

Maybe you are sick, down or depressed.
Then today, do not look out onto your field as a day to work.
Today your field gives to you, and you should take what you need. this is what it is for.
Do not beat yourself up for what you cannot give today. this assumes your field is only meaningful for its future.
And before you're well again, remember this moment well, so you may
Prevent the urge to be disappointed the next time you are less than productive.
If you must work to feel worthwhile, work to budget for a fact of being human:
You are always sometimes less than productive, and occasionally your setbacks come in unfortunate forms, at inconvenient times.

\hypertarget{attention}{%
\section{Attention}\label{attention}}

Think of what's happening in your garden this very moment: nothing, while you're sitting here thinking.
Reflect only enough to improve your actions.
Pri is the optimizing and managing of all your goals.
All goals rely on a single, limited source of attention, and existence: you.
Attention. order, reduce in the order (pictured below). ``a place for everything, everything in its place''
At its best, this limiting fact drastically improves the reality of plans and goals.
At its worst, it is the most common oversight responsible for bloated \protect\hyperlink{c.h.u.d.}{chud}.
Goal importance partly depends on context (c3.6).
Group your goals by shared actions, places, or times. make/group/keep,
Align self and cake.
Ask what it would take to change (if possible), and whether change is worth it.
Savings occur anytime you complete an action that serves various goals.
An example is grouping (c3.35.4).
Apply to ideas, plans, goals, or home things.
Time is the constant (or denominator) for forces, forgetting, pri, and lib.
Do not ignore time.
Estimate durations accurately for goal accomplishment.
Study time to learn reality, self, and their link.
Continually assess whether goal benefits outweighs costs of time.
Maybe it seems unnecessary to represent work satisfaction and relationship quality in terms of carrots and tomatoes.
When you get bored, ask yourself why attempting to understand and define yourself bores you.
What is happening in your life, and what is in your control if these are unclear?
If you are not reflecting on your life, your garden is a foggy labyrinth, and you are a drunk gardener wearing oven-mitts.
You are pushed like a sail by any wind, the forces of reality.
A force is any cause of change.
A force underlies every action involved in a goal, yours or otherwise.
There are forces within your control, and forces outside.
Maintenance is the cost of force to neither move toward nor away from a goal.
Alignment is when norm or natural force causes your goal to be more likely. moment
To align is to adjust your goal to be more like another force, usually one acting against your goal.
Study how forces work against you.

\hypertarget{now}{%
\section{Now}\label{now}}

Now is the only use-case of shared space, in time.
A moment is any now that is not the latest, either future or past.
A record of now becomes past `nows' of variable use-case.
That is, we might reflect on the previous nows that we shared.
Note that past nows do not maintain the same level of rigor. they are degraded to hype when mis-replayed, misunderstood, or accessed under changed priorities.
In seeing passage, we might speculate on future nows to be shared.
The discourse of past or future is always at least partially hype, but real (use) when bet on.

``Just like you, others are trying to figure out what goes on in their own garden.* ppl are different versions of each others' pri ({[}see also c9.70{]}{[}norms style{]}).''
Amid the goals and forces of this chapter, none of what is described includes using words. reader, you will begin to understand their nature in the next chapter, bet, but as it pertains words that ppl use with each other, not until the last chapter, comm.
Consider ppl in terms of the four places of your life:

\begin{verbatim}
1. On your garden dealing with your self.
2. On someone else's garden.
3. At work making something for others for money.
4. Getting something someone else made (market).
\end{verbatim}

Sometimes you are at your garden's edge looking elsewhere.
For example, when you read an email or social media feed, as if looking across your neighbor's plot,
Studying how to bring your lettuce back to life, or celebrating your friend's successful pumpkin patch.

\hypertarget{gate}{%
\section{Gate}\label{gate}}

Despite garden-based pris, most of your time is spent outside your garden, and mostly for work (about 80,000 hours in your life).
Acknowledge the ppl in your pris, yet don't let them distract.
Notice how long you leave your garden and to where.
Spend only as much time needed away for your pris.
For example, most time on others' gardens, and any more than the minimum at work or market is cake. when in doubt, go home and stare at your plants. at least that cake is free.

\hypertarget{work}{%
\section{Work}\label{work}}

Where do you get seeds for food from and how did you know to plant them?
From other ppl, right? No silly, you don't know how to garden a sandwich!
Lucky for you, many of the most important crops you want are already grown, prepared and handed to you--in exchange for money.
Money is traded for maintenance of, or insurance for self and cake, like apples, miracle medical procedures, and a toilet to take your poop somewhere else.
Work is performing a specific task on a collective garden, like an institution's in exchange for money. it is a pre-arranged visit to another garden for a specified time.
Whether or not you like it, or it directly fulfills garden needs, work is made to serve norms, not you.
Norms are all actions assumed of (or about) the ``average'' person. they are the web of forces of all actions of all ppl, including work, religion, popular attitudes, and doubts.

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}}

If you have a job that pays you to think, your mind is hired to make norms products real.
Instead of your reality, your work is to translate norms's reality, chud-adjusted.
Norms assume you will work for money for goods.
Language, agreed usage of words, is made from norms.
Norms push against individuality (except where it provides a lucrative job opportunity).
Relationships (rltp) are goals about ppl (ppl).
Good ones are aligned with your goals.
Bad ones cost more.
A rltp is a reciprocal pair of bets, yours of them, and vice versa. one is the better and the other is the bet and bet on.
Rltps, especially family members, coordinate many goals for savings.

\hypertarget{others}{%
\section{Others}\label{others}}

Maybe they are your friend, and need help with some unruly vines, or maybe you just like their apples.
Sometimes, ppl will contribute to your goals, as if bringing water to crops you didn't recognize need them. 4. sometimes ppl will try to water your crops when they don't need watering.
Sometimes you'll return with higher morale or a bag of apples.
Sometimes you'll need to water some crops that need to be watered, because the sight of their neglect cannot be ignored.
The challenges that overwhelm you are the same for others, just not always the same amount nor at the same time.
The place, duration and impact on your pris are the basic measurements of a rltp.
Pick work and rltps, including friends, that maximize your other pris including possibly one that maximizes time and money to apply to other pris.
Maximally align with norms with least compromise to pris. get along with ppl.
Ppl are the part of pris that require the most care, and fewest words.
A good rltp is a contract of the reciprocated actions (use) between two ppl.
A bad rltp is hyped mutual bets (unaligned with actions), that waste time.

A stranger comes to your garden at the end of a long day, which you realize only when you hear him chopping his jaw at you. you look up.
``No really, consider it, right now. imagine the most realistic, attainable, best life you could have.
Imagine taking the first step and then stay with the thought. listen to the fear that surfaces.
For the moment, never mind how the world has gotten in your way.
How are you in your own way?''
He seems to be in your way. he's staring past your wet forehead.
``See your doubts with curiosity. now bet on what you tell yourself you believe. bet on overcoming them.''
But you mostly only think of frustration and say, ``i appreciate the suggestion.''
``Let's both bet. name what you believe you can accomplish tomorrow, in terms of what you think holds you back most.
If you make it happen before sun-up, you'll be over the most daunting hurdle between you and your outcome.
And i'll give you the equivalent of your harvest, today. if you fail, you leave me today's harvest.''
``Okay,'' you say. you'll show him.
``The rocks on the far field. they're on a slippery slope. to build the home i want, i need those rocks, but i'm afraid of falling. i've collected every rock on my land and i need those rocks. tomorrow i'll finish my foundation with rocks from the slippery slope.''
The stranger and you have set up a bet, a type of belief.

\hypertarget{bet-1}{%
\section{Bet}\label{bet-1}}

A bet is a plan template for reconciling reality with chud, to accomplish goals.
Betting is confronting costs, habits, unknowns and doubts that stand in the way of your wants and dreams.
The time that passes and the status of your goal when it runs out are an intersection of reality: the world and you. to name them, is to shed chud.
Every idea you hold is a bet with a rolling deadline, idiosyncratic successes, and revisions.
Bet wins shorten your plan, and the distance to your goal. losses should guide revisions to your chud.
To bet, name:
A step in your plan,
A deadline to achieve it, and
The c.h.u.d. for that duration.
Blitz to revise and win, and log your actions.
When the deadline arrives, take stock.
Compare your action log to your plan.
Identify chud factors that best explain discrepancies.
Revise plan, updated with chud factor predictions.
(Record time to do the next bet or goal, revise, etc.)
Start the next bet or goal.

The next morning you woke to a field in disarray and a letter. you had worked harder than you planned, and still fell short of your goal.
``If you did more than you would have without the bet, you won something, including evidence that there is some commitment in you to make your dreams come true.''
The biggest reward is not positive: accept you failed,
And partly due to a miscalculation.
Therefore, likely other parts of your plan are misguided, and your goal is further than you estimate.
If you disagree, let's bet again. first, take a minute to learn from your planning mistake.

\hypertarget{c.h.u.d.}{%

Even if you make a plan and bet on it, you can fail.

And, by extension, clues for why we fail.
Chud encompasses the changes in you, the world, and your goal for you to achieve it.

\hypertarget{cost}{%
\section{Cost}\label{cost}}

Costs (\protect\hyperlink{self-self}{c2.51}) and habits are knowable facts.
Observers could independently note and agree on your costs and habits.
Costs are the unadjusted record of transactions in your life.
Referring to cost is referring to typical transactions for a goal.
For example, a relationship with an alcoholic poses a risk of violence.
The unadjusted, plain record of everything you have physically done, is your habit.
Referring to habit is referring to patterns of behavior.
For example, i eat every morning before 9 am.

\hypertarget{habits}{%
\section{Habits}\label{habits}}

Habits are your most likely and reliable food or cake actions.
Bad habits are forces working against your goals.
Good habits are aligned with goals.

\hypertarget{unknowns}{%
\section{Unknowns}\label{unknowns}}

Unknowns and doubts are the gap between your real and perceived costs and habits.
If you have not arrived at the goal, there are unknowns.
Unknowns are all that are fully out of your control (analogous to statistical `error').
For example, a train might stop you from arriving on time.
Unknowns are reduced by estimating causes of failure.
For example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I will die, but not know how or when. The cause is unknown.\\
\item
  I will die due to a natural disaster or cancer. The cause is named, and the unknown is pushed to those things' underlying causes.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{doubt}{%
\section{Doubt}\label{doubt}}

Doubts are misperceptions caused or perpetuated by your habit.
Like costs, doubts are the patterns of unknown.
Doubt is any systematic error that is possible to be addressed by another human of equal ability and resources.
For example, ``self-fulfilled prophesies'', irrational fear or anxiety.
Good doubts temper an optimistic plan.
Otherwise (bad) doubts: fuel bad habits and fantasies. like fear, anxiety, and jealousy, reflect overestimations. like narrow-mindedness, reflect underestimations. like distraction and boredom can be: anxiety about your future. discomfort toward present reality or distrust in your past.
Most of these issues, if deep enough, require therapy.

\section{Classroom}\label{classroom}}

A classroom is a special case of market and work; the direct and shared exchange of mental work, for the purpose of improving individual pris.
No one chose to be born. everyone begins life with their own unnamed and unanswered problems.
Books are an author's answers; they can only tell a student what the answer is not (quite).
Instead of teaching how to read between the lines, let the student define the problem through their reality and life goals.
Let them write the plan and teach them only what is needed to succeed.
Imagine a perfect course exists, designed to teach you to fulfill your specific ambitions.
Every aspect of what you need to know, that is known and communicable, is the only thing written.
Everything that cannot be known but must be discovered or practiced, is laid out as a set of instructions, described in the words that maximize the learning opportunity, and your progress.
Rather than a course in a classroom, the perfect class is a manual to reference as you live your life, or at least until you've internalized its contents:
When to take a break to strategize your decisions, lessons on what opportunities to watch for and resist, and so on.
Any social role you wish to take on, artist, engineer, therapist, insurance salesperson, reliable partner, is customized intimately, curated perfectly for what you need.
Any rltp or interpersonal skill that is realistically possible for you is preceded with the guidance and education that prepares you emotionally to choose the right experiences that set you up to be most likely to find and make the most of opportunities to share yourself with another.

\hypertarget{prompt}{%

Is there a better version of you?

This is a boot camp whose purpose is
To train adults to think harder, clearer and more effectively.
To produce intelligent solutions for personal and social puzzles.
To have a higher cognitive discipline.
To instill shared cake about reason, thinking and discourse.
To empower.
It is a training program designed to break down bad habits of thought, and build good ones while immersed here, a culture of rational thinking isolated from the outside world.

\hypertarget{challenge}{%
\section{Challenge}\label{challenge}}

Here you will relentlessly confront your ideas about the world, with instructors drilling intellectual skills (writing essays, arguing for ideas, and developing proposals for action).
You will be trained to move toward your goals with focus, even in the face of perceptual, physical, or emotional distractions.
Over time, students could expect to cultivate a sharper focus on cognitive objectives, resilience to distractions and challenges.
If you graduate, it will be with the ability to identify, develop, and communicate ideal critical, rational arguments, positions or plans (orally or written) given the available knowledge, finite time, and resources at hand (reference material, teamwork).
You will also learn a code of behavior for being a community leader,
Collaborating or competing with an irrational world.
The central requirement for applicants will be a commitment to better understand the self and world.

Lessons depend on students' prior knowledge.
A student
Has a goal that can be better named and planned.
Requires time away from betting.

Students learn to represent their knowledge in words; to prefer better, alternative words. a student sees the impersonal as more reliable both for selfish goals and social ones.
A bad student studies to avoid action, or for its own sake.
A student writes ideas and goals to their instructor.

When reading, dismiss only what you fully believe is an intentional lie.
More generally, read to assess your bet on the words reflecting truth.
Whether to a single word, a line, chapter, or book.
Assign weights (0 to 9) to what you read, to complete this prompt:

\hypertarget{bet-problem}{%
\section{Problem}\label{bet-problem}}

Speaking your mind is difficult to do accurately.
A memory system dealing with language is tasked to translate thoughts into the right words from tens of thousands. it is prone to inaccuracies.
Similarly, a listener focused on comprehending, is not likely to monitor all the incidental priming effects of words on a memory system.
Words said and heard impact both parties' beliefs and behaviors.
Saying words or hearing and understanding a word is a very small physical action, to describe real actions and consequences.
The issue is that words can be more and less right, more and less helpful, and without intervention, it is very difficult to know how much this is true in any example of word use.
Bad words keep chud expensive and waste time.
The cost of an individual word is tiny, but we say tens of thousands per day (levelt).

\hypertarget{word-bet}{%
\section{Bet}\label{word-bet}}

A good general bet about words is to begin assuming every word is a bet on hypotheticals, which can be true (reality) or false (fantasy).
A plan is a bet on a winning arrangement of words that result in the goal.
Reading, thinking, saying, and writing a word perpetuates that word's idea over others, either moving you toward a goal, or your habit.

\hypertarget{simulation}{%

Words efficiently simulate possible worlds. you can think through far more situations with words, than you can (or should) act out.
Your goals can be described in words, and words can be easily crossed out and revised.
Good words maximize productivity of thought, move you beyond pitfalls of chud, direct attention to pris, and predict reality; improve decisions and make you smarter.
By thinking about all words you experience (lib), you can take control to limit your word use toward more productive ones, improving read and write decisions, increasing focus and time for goals.

It caused you to name in the first place. this cause is ``it''. good-ref is giving the best name for our desired comm.
For example, consider that during my 9:00am appointment with you, I yawn while you are talking.\\
You say, ``I must be boring you.''
``it'' is the following circumstance I want to convey:
I woke at 8:30 A.M.,
I wanted to sleep until 9:30 A.M., and
I want to hear what you were going to say.
Each of these (below) are slightly different refs, ways to say ``it'', ranked from most to least awe:

\begin{verbatim}
1. You're not, please continue.  
2. No, I'm tired.  
3. No, I woke early.  
4. Don't make assumptions.  
5. I'm not.  
6. "I woke at 8:30am, but wanted to sleep until 9:30am, so I think  
7. "I yawned because I am tired. I can see why you thought I was   
8. (Nothing)

All of the refs above combined suggest the ``it'' you want to convey.
A good-ref is the one that uses truth to focus and advance communication.
Below are the ref attributes that make each choice unique (and less good).
Give a simple reason to return to communicating (example 1 above).

H0 = history. habit is to history as action is to doc. good
H1 = plan (pri.txt, proj\_doc.txt)
H2 = doubt especially for bet.

\hypertarget{word-alternatives}{%
\section{Alternatives}\label{word-alternatives}}

Alts are any idea which measurably deviates a plan, and are defined directly with respect to the target idea.
For example, bad is an alt to good, as in ``good-vs-bad''.
Any other valid modes, if at all, are in support of maximal revision in these primary ones.
A plan comprises: 1.the decided action 2.the best bet on it
Alternative actions 4.the goal 5.the relevant chud
Good goals and their plans are supported by uses from your own history (self-h), and next best is norm or others' use or data that generalizes.
For example, a plan for a similar goal has previously succeeded.

\hypertarget{letters}{%
\section{Letters}\label{letters}}

Mnemonics are letter memory aids.
Reducing a word to a letter increases cognitive efficiency, as long as that letter stands for an idea you will frequently encounter.
These letters illustrate kinds of word usage (not exhaustive):

\texttt{f} define; function\\
\texttt{i} synonym, sense, ``i.e.'', ``as in'',\\
\texttt{e} example, data-point, untested data\\
\texttt{h} history (implied h0)
\texttt{h1} claim, thesis. vs h0 or h2.
\texttt{x} cross-references, xref\\
\texttt{d} data or evidence, summary
\texttt{v} version / revise\\
\texttt{vs} an alternative, sibling of a shared parent category.

\hypertarget{notes}{%
\section{Notes}\label{notes}}

Good notes clarify pri (content) within bets from secondary ones.
In a doc, par is a grouped set of words roughly equivalent to a complex sentence.
It has a primary subject and predicate, and includes any immediately relevant branches from either.
In practice it is between 1 and 4 clauses.
Good par successfully denotes a link between two ideas, with the following form:
A syntactic tree, where\\
{[}Newline{]} is the right path in a fork,\\
First indent ('' -``) is the left path in a fork,\\
Subsequent newline indents or in-line''--'' are siblings\\
Left to right are siblings\\
Double linebreak ends the local tree.
When word order is a left-to-right walk of a right-branching syntactic tree, sentence can be written in lines of random lengths, and read equally as unambiguously.
Restrict reference and vocabulary to simple- or plain- english to reduce amibiguity.

\hypertarget{transparency}{%

Make folder and file names i-goals as transparent as possible imply or reveal its (hidden) members.
Promote or consolidate high frequency items or only-childs.

When creating or reusing a word for new applications, this principle should be a factor.

\hypertarget{recipe}{%

A recipe is one of the best ways to arrange plans.
Lessons and instructions use a recipe format.
The recipe format highlights the ideas and links of your point and minimizes excessive style.
List key ideas.

A scientist works to win bets against the unknown. they are a professional writer, evaluated on two metrics:
For their new content.
The net benefit on goal outcomes.
A scientist-researcher is a writer, a data-collector and hypothesis tester.
A scientist-scholar is a reader, curating toward theory development and comm.
More will be said about scientist more broadly. here we focus strictly on the aspect of a scientist which is to develop the description of the world, properly.

\hypertarget{framework}{%
\section{Framework}\label{framework}}

Framework (frame) is a cluster of definitions.
What metric can be used to compare and test bets on words?
Such a metric requires a general framework for cognition.
This is that general framework.
Just as a child learns skills from ``put it in the box'' to ``put it together,'' and ``solve the problem you creatively set up to solve the impossible,'' so too the highest cognitive function --these days a cooperative one beyond the speed or control of any individual-- deserves treatment of its abilities and applications in order of processing difficulty and utility; utility in contributing to itself however it sees fit, but especially in its allocation of finite resources.

\[ h1 where p = cognition, good.p = p(wit.goal.sort|pri) \]
Cognitive acts should be engaged in as a pyramid of levels (like food pyramid), number of tasks (width of level).
For example, a base height of 4 (levels) = 4 topics on bottom level,
On 2nd, 2 on 3rd and 1 on 4th. where the bottom level is the
For example, assuming a goal, make an action plan (blitz) constrained by number of tasks by type as follows:
Sort (base task)

Make (minimum viable)
Test (edit, sim, revise)
Use (reliable, helpful)
Additional tasks must ``wait'' to be addressed until a task of the same level becomes complete and removed from the pyramid, leaving a slot to be replaced.
This is a frame that gives a starting point for assessing how and what optimal capacity and boundaries exist for a human as a cognitive being.

\chapter{Change}\label{change}}

\hypertarget{revision}{%
\section{Revision}\label{revision}}

Neutrally, a WORD may be replaced by another. As a process which takes effort, do so to improve, and we will call it REVISION. REVISION is the change of WORDS to improve actions of yourself or others.
REVISION is how we know reflection is happening, described here in VERSIONS (v\#) of a response.
For example, consider the following revisions (v1-3) describing this brief argument:

\begin{verbatim}
1.  1: "Nobody follows doctors' orders."\
    2: "My parents do, religiously."\
    1: "They're the exception."\
    2: "You're not exposed to minorities."  
2.  v1  
    a)  1 makes a false generalization.
    b)  2 illustrates a counterpoint, and 1 gets mad.
    c)  1 dismisses it, and 2 gets mad.  
3.  v2  
    a)  1 generalizes from WORK experience.
    b)  2 argues with parents' experience, and 1 gets mad.
    c)  1 dismisses and 2 get mad.  
4.  v3  
    a)  1 argues outside 2's experience.
    b)  2 uses personal experience, thinking it's impenetrable.
    c)  Failing and hurt, 2 insults.  
\end{verbatim}

The example aims to illustrate revisions which increase the amount of responsibility, control, and preventable future behavior on part of the writer, without much change in WORD count.

\hypertarget{change-plan}{%
\section{Plan}\label{change-plan}}

Good revisions better describe what we know to have happened, and predict what will happen (again).
Reality is what determines whether each version is better.
Revise prior prompt responses only to help your current prompt response.
If your goal deals with different assumptions about the truth, change the prompt to whatever gets you to write the most helpful words for your goal.

\begin{verbatim}
1.  For example, a prompt referring to University student experiences can be re-framed for non-University experiences.
2.  A common (problematic) assumption is that you are emotionally ready to be SELF-critical.
3.  Do not change the prompt so you can be lazy.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{think-1}{%
\section{Think}\label{think-1}}

Elsewhere, we will establish variations on ultimate questions.
One variant is the superlative presupposition, which becomes an imperative (plan).
For illustration, all questions presuppose and command, ``think!''
As compliment, all words can be seen as an answer to this question (good or bad).
Supposing just as questions can be revised to their superlatives, we don't bother to ask them, and focus on the superlative of answers.
Thus is an example basis of good revision: to bring the particular apprehension to a universally relevant call to action, responding to the implied imperative of all questions, ``think.''

\hypertarget{change-plan2}{%
\section{Plan}\label{change-plan2}}

The goal of words is to express ideas of maximum cake tomorrow.
Since few words meet these criteria, start by revising toward fewer words.
Make ideas clear and concrete.
Provide just enough context to remember the basis of the key ideas.
Precision depends on purpose.

\begin{verbatim}
1.  List. Name relevant ideas for goal.
2.  Write a plan, (ordered links).
3.  Doubt. Assert the strongest rebuttal to the plan.
4.  Bet. Improve ideas and links by addressing weakness and clarity.
5.  Read. Wager its cake (e.g., Relative to another plan).
\end{verbatim}

When reflecting, reflect only on ``how can i help my future self?'' And impose time and word limits.
A bad doc is stream-of-consciousness.

\hypertarget{prompts}{%
\section{Prompts}\label{prompts}}

Prompts elicit conflicts (truth) between self and norm, to improve plans for your goals.
Time and word limits work together to encourage a balance between reflecting on truth and describing it.

\hypertarget{word-limit}{%
\section{Word Limit}\label{word-limit}}

Word limits combat needless words and distracting tangents. a word limit keeps your attention.
A word limit is a proxy for a prompt's complexity.
Try to write the exact number of words.
Good word limits require cutting out unhelpful words, change figurative words to concrete, ideally assertive and falsifiable.
For every plan you make: assert a word limit before writing to be reminded of your initial intentions, and be challenged to express ideas clearly. become skilled at using only the fewest words necessary, to reveal and clarify cake.
If you exceed the limit and there is no end in sight, stop and reassess.

\hypertarget{time-limit}{%
\section{Time Limit}\label{time-limit}}

Combined with the word limit, the time limit dictates how precise your words should be.
Use extra time to improve word choice.
For example, given a 50-word limit, 1 minute (1m, 50w) encourages free writing with minimal restrictions on quality of thought, while 4 minutes encourages more careful selection of words.

\hypertarget{lessons}{%
\section{Lessons}\label{lessons}}

Lessons are an ordered set of prompts, usually three to four, up to 60 minutes and 250 words. a prompt's word count is the number of words to be added to your document.
Lessons target inconsistencies between reality and pris.
They are designed to be revisited and revised repeatedly.
A 0w prompt means revise, but do not increase the word total.
The first prompts in lessons are warm-ups to direct your attention. they ask for names of ideas.
The remaining prompts are for thinking, requiring you to make links between your warm-up ideas. done right, you will face some new truths.

\section{Problem}\label{comm-problem}}

Communication happens from one being to another.
The function is to direct attention to a circumstance of high importance: sharing information.
For example, the vervet screech that specifically means, ``snake''.
While the vervet makes or hears calls about threats of immediate, nearby importance, the breadth of human communication can direct attention to circumstances of distant places and times.
This is an echo of the breadth of attention and information humans engage. for some reason entangled between information, sharing it, there is subjectivity of importance.
The consequence is ambiguity in the value of a communicative act.

\hypertarget{style}{%
\section{Style}\label{style}}

Recognition, reading familiar words is easier than retrieval from memory, of words to write. is- savings on revision.
Only save docs that you bet will be useful enough later to save time, overall.
Once saved, we assume a doc will be read later, and provide cake. this is the primary type of comm we engage in.
Comm is the exchange of words from oneself to another. other examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are rereading, a carefully crafted party invite, or a lease agreement.
The goal of comm is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the inherent and practical problems that arise.

\hypertarget{comm-comm}{%
\section{Comm}\label{comm-comm}}

Writing a word creates a static record of a word.
No person is identical with a future or past self, with any other person, and all of these relationships are in part unknown. ({[}c4.1{]}{[}ppl{]})
The problem of comm is the difference in meaning between reader and writer of the same word.
Even if you wrote the word, your later self may read a different meaning for that word.
Good comm attempts to systematically reconcile these issues.
Bad comm takes advantage of them at the cost of clarity and honesty.
Ppl vary in how they apprehend the world, and therefore they can vary in
1. Precise understanding of meanings.
2. Trust (usually writer more than reader).
The real world is particular; each experience is an example.
A word describes a set of similar experiences.
1. WORDS are never definite and certain in what they describe of the real world.
2. A WORD's definition is a generalization.
As such, words are
1. less precise than reality.
2. better designed to hypothesize and predict.
To improve comm, study the difference between content and style.

\hypertarget{difference}{%
\section{Difference}\label{difference}}

Pris between ppl (writer and reader) differ.
Difference in pris alter content of ideas.
Good style is change in words to minimize change in ideas between reader and writer.
Versions describe identical content with difference in style between them.
A plan for a doc is an earlier version of the (same) final doc.
For example, you today vs you in five years.

\hypertarget{comm-norm}{%
\section{Norms}\label{comm-norm}}

Comm norms assume reading and writing have no intrinsic goals.
A doc's arguments for why to read it are a style called pitch.
Pitch can be accomplished, for example, by

\begin{verbatim}
1.  stroking the ego and intelligence of the reader.
2.  framing attacks as agreeable observations.
\end{verbatim}

The maximum common self-pris across ppl are the optimal arguments for pitch. e-food vs.~cake.
Brand is pitch that distorts truth, a form of bad style.
For example, consider the goal of describing the properties of \textbf{apples} with the purpose of selling them:

\begin{verbatim}
1.  CONTENT: **Apples are healthy but sugary.**\
2.  STYLE: **Apples are tasty and nutritious.**\
3.  BRAND: **Apples are healthy.**\
\end{verbatim}

People who do not distinguish food from cake will be persuaded by brand more than pitch.

Lib is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you write, save, and read, by organizing it for best application, and providing feedback to help your future decisions to write, save, and read.
The scope of lib is the collection of your words over a lifetime.

Lib is to docs as home is to possessions.
Lib aims to maximize the cake of words you save, and ideally, reduce future efforts to plan and accomplish pris, through making the best of your thoughts easy to find.

objectives.

Explore the main ways these two lists relate.

For example,
1. If I don't get a B, I won't keep my scholarship, and will have to
get a job which will likely lower all my grades.

\hypertarget{task-4.-15m-100w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 4. 15m, 100w.}}{Task 4. 15m, 100w.}}\label{task-4.-15m-100w.}}

What is the least you can do toward the course requirements and still achieve your long term goals?
Consider cutting the work from list two,
that doesn't overlap with one.

Examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Graphic design is fun but not necessary. I could drop it and
  still graduate.
\item
  If I get a D, I'll still pass, graduate, and be able to start my own
  business.
\end{enumerate}

Add 100 more words to your description.

\hypertarget{task-5.-15m-50w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 5. 15m, 50w.}}{Task 5. 15m, 50w.}}\label{task-5.-15m-50w.}}

Negotiate ways to make direct progress on your first list while fulfilling the second list.

For example, my personality class requires a term paper.
To align with my business goal, maybe the professor will let me write
on ``personality traits of Entrepreneurs.''

Add up to 50 words, and revise.

\item
  Often you will define experiences by your priorities and immediate
  desires.
\item
  Experiences out of line with your desires are dreaded, and those in
  line with them are eagerly anticipated.
\item
  For example, a college student dreads midterms and anticipates spring
  break. Each are about one weeklong, yet the feeling of TIME passing
  and the motivation to engage with challenges are very different.
\item
  Anticipations can create disappointment, so reduce speculation,
  especially its harmful effects on you.
\item
  Do more of what you like when you most need it, try to appreciate
  what you dread, as it is, including the suffering.
\item
  Task 1. 4m, 50w. List 4 GOALS to accomplish for midterms, before
  spring break
\item
  Task 2. 4m, 50w. List 4 GOALS for the best spring break you can
  imagine.
\item
  Task 3. 15m, 200w. There are only so many hours in a day. What
  aspects of SELF-care can you incorporate during your midterms to
  improve your sanity, and hopefully your midterm performance?
\item
  We know what happens if you don't. You're staring at your phone;
  you're reading random articles on the internet and wasting TIME.
\item
  Let's take that same honest realism and intentionally PLAN better
  alternatives: instead of garbage breaks, how about spring breaks?
\item
  In what strategic ways can you get a head start on your spring break
  GOALS, as a form of SELF-care and therapy during your marathon of
  midterm WORK?
\item
  Write out your midterm GOALS with SELF-care and/or spring break
  strategically built in.
\item
  Task 4. 15m, 200w. Now imagine that spring break more fully. You're
  spending TIME on one of your GOALS, when suddenly you remember
  something, you need to do for midterms.
\item
  Maybe you get an email from your instructor or boss, or there's a
  project that looms large.
\item
  What are you going to do to be okay with this intrusion? Would it help
  to allow some TIME to WORK on it, or is it vital that you embrace your
  needs and resist any urge to do WORK?
  65.1. Regardless of how you might ideally respond, PLAN for SELF-
  compassion for when you might unexpectedly struggle
  emotionally.
  65.2. Write out your spring break GOALS with midterm GOALS
  incorporated.

\hypertarget{self-testing}{%
\chapter{``Self-testing''}\label{self-testing}}

All of this book is a lesson in simulation,
because this is a book with words in it,
and words are simulations of reality.
This lesson is an exercise to fearlessly
take action. Since you'll be writing,
it works better if the ``action'' to take is,
itself, a writing task.
It could be an upcoming exam, or writing your will.
The exercise works whether you are
75\% done or 5\% prepared to start.

\textbf{Task 1. 3m, 40w.}

Think about the challenging task you've identified.
Finish a sentence like this:
``The purpose of this task is to\ldots{}''
Perhaps ``demonstrate my knowledge of the endocrine system,'' or
``communicate my values and divvy up my valuables.''

So that I don't continue to prime your death, the remainder of this lesson will focus on the youthful experience of learning.

\textbf{Task 2. 2m, 0w.}

Picture someone who doesn't struggle to do this task.
They would score 100\% or write the perfect paper/assignment.
Assume they weren't born able to do this.
How did they get that skill?
Edit the same 4 things to try to make them more concrete and tractable.

\textbf{Task 3. 8m, 100w.}

Assume that ideal performer writes a custom quiz on
the very areas you're struggling with.
Write quiz questions that tests your learning objectives.
For example, I'm working on a paper that deals with
how talking happens in the brain.
A question in my quiz is, ``define the two contrasting theoretical
positions in 15 words, each.''

\textbf{Task 4. 2m, 0w.}

Revise your quiz so that it would take about 30 minutes for your expert to complete, with questions that can be answered in 5 to 25 words.
Add word and time limits for each question.

\textbf{Task 5. 20-25m.}

Take your quiz.
