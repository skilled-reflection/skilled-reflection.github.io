\section{Author's Note}\label{authors-note}}

This is an early copy of Skilled Reflection, and much of it is still in development. Thank you for your patience. I welcome any and all constructive feedback (\href{mailto:skilledreflection@gmail.com}{\nolinkurl{skilledreflection@gmail.com}}). Check back later for a revised and updated version.

\hypertarget{foreward-to-version-2.}{%
\section{Foreward to Version 2.}\label{foreward-to-version-2.}}

when i first set out to write SR as a book i quickly realized a problem could hang me up forever, both simple and superficial.\\
It is the problem of framing CONTENT (STYLE), as basic as knowing what order to present the information, so as to maximally reveal the value.
For illustration, this is at least the 15th unique thesis for a preface, and even as i write it I know i am woefully failing.
Left unaddressed, the consequence is a poverty of readership and intellectual engagement, and the inevitable death of SR.

in version one of this book, i deliberately set aside this problem, for the personally more desparate issue, of attempting to name and contain a system, at all. while i succeeded my decided priority, i failed the known order issue
i must say, as i issue the 2nd version, the consequence of the problem, has crippled me.
version 2 takes the first step in remediation by streamlining all essential terms and links of the system into a shared frame, called ``the garden'' (introduced in version one, as concept, but not integrated in practice). Even still, in this respect version 2 is proto, at best.

i pen this Foreward to the 2nd Version at the advent of having spelled out critical details, via example, of the problem, namely, spelling out my process of revising \emph{away} STYLE from CONTENT. the spelling should show you in backward fashion why and how i write the way i do.
i hope that for those who fell off the previous train, you find renewed interest to ride again.

\item
  The WORDS in this book are meaningful only when you apply them to your life.
\item
  If you wrote the date and time as requested in step 4, you have proven enough to yourself that you are open to trying

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{12}
\tightlist
\item
  This book presents plain and obvious facts of life as the antidote to modern complexities of life.
\item
  In most cases, the relevance can be seen more clearly if you \protect\hyperlink{words}{simulate} the experience being described, or explicitly consider it in your life (See \protect\hyperlink{read}{Role of Reading}). Let's practice. For example, consider going on a camping trip.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Look at the clock and determine when you should expect to arrive.
  \item
    Whatever that time, when you arrive, you will likely be over- prepared, under-prepared, or 1-3 hours late.
  \item
    Or you might be an experienced camper.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Either way, this is your only shot at a lifelong camping trip for yourself on Earth.
\item
  My guess is you are very likely late to your own life.
\item
  The games we (PPL, SCIENTISTs, etc.) play to explain away this fact, end with this book.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{in two worlds}\label{in-two-worlds}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{17}
\item
  To understand this book will require you to find and repair the disconnect between your mind's image of TIME, and the one you are physically bound to.
\item
  If you fail, you will die in two worlds, the world you imagine you could have
  lived, and the one you did.
\item
  You, however, would like to ace your own life.
\item
  Part one of this book (The Garden) gives you all the general answers, and the basic tools for finding the answers particular to you.
\item
  Part two teaches you how to (re)build your tools.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{22}
\tightlist
\item
  The one thing up to you that this book will not do is draw the line between need and want.
\item
  In this book, FOOD refers to needs and CAKE refers to wants.
\item
  You must practice discerning which is which for you, until it is second-nature.
\item
  Then, all decisions can be made as follows:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If hungry, eat FOOD.
  \item
    If full, prepare and pack FOOD.
  \item

  Beware of thinking CAKE is FOOD.

\item
  Likely at this point you have slipped into thinking this is a book discussing a philosophy, but it is not.
\item
  FOOD vs CAKE is not understood and solved as a mental exercise in your living room, but by experiencing and paying attention.
\item
  What's more, if you don't have a living room, CAKE can be painfully obvious.
\end{enumerate}

  The odds are you aren't homeless and will avoid becoming so.
\item
  As with any hypothetical, practice finding the nearest analogous, personally meaningful experience:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You couldn't find your car in the middle of winter.
  \item
    You went camping without waterproof gear and it rained.
  \item

  \item
    You were isolated in your house for most of two years during a global pandemic.

\item
  Whatever the circumstance, your HABIT protests for a change in PLANS.
\item
  However small or profound the suffering or its threat:
\item
  There is initially terror, frustration and suffering.
\item
  Enduring, suffering will change.
\item
  You will need far less FOOD than you thought, giving more time and quality CAKE you really desire.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{35}
\tightlist
\item
  In the first half of this book is a conceptual metaphor described as a Garden.
\item
  It is a mental model of reality, designed to bring clarity.
\item
  Your Garden is your GOALS put on key IDEAS of this book.
\item
  You need the Garden to combat the idealistic side of your mind, inclined to ignore TIME and your SELF, which sets you up for failure and suffering.
\item
  The second half of these chapters elaborates explicitly on the key IDEAs.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  SELF, PPL, and PRI are each dimensions of ways to move in the world
  which are essential to existing NOW.
\item
  Read these movements with ATTN to ACTs, not WORDs.
\item
  In SELF, you must deal with a BODY and its persistent need for FOOD until you die.
\item
  In PPL, you must deal with all other SELFs, and the strong NEEDs imposed on you as long as you share physical space.
\item
  In PRI, you must deal with the fact that you can only be in one place at a time, doing one thing, until you die.
\item
  BET is the dawn of WORDs; what's necessary to alter your ACTs, and to know that you have done so truly. To ALTER is the first basic property of the general CLASS of ACTs called using WORDs.
  As you can literally apprehend and name objects under the sun, every WORD instantly affords new power, yet every WORD also has a shadow.

  They are designed to be useful at any time, and especially repeatedly.
\item
  Don't wait to finish the book to try one out, because they are pivotal to Skilled Reflection.

  WORDS in all capital letters are IDEAS that have specific definitions that differ
  slightly from conventional use.
\item
  For example, ``WORK'' is an IDEA referring to ``careers'', but not `yard WORK'.
\item
  Do not overlook the nuances for these terms, they are the result of careful decisions about the FOOD and CAKE of the IDEAs.

\section{Your Garden}\label{your-garden}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Imagine your life takes place in a garden.
\item
  Visualizing your life as a garden allows you to ground actions and PLANS.
\item
  The mind analyzes well with visual space.
\item
  In this garden we'll consider all your biological needs -- eating, sleeping especially -- as literal.
\item
  Your plants are GOALS, and gardening is your PLAN.
\item
  FOOD and CAKE exists in the form of fruit from plants.
\item
  Whatever it takes to obtain your CAKE you can consider as an act of gardening.
\item
  Every one of your life ambitions, GOALS, is buried in the ground as seeds.
\item
  Finding a life partner, acquiring a car or promotion, or resolving a conflict with
  your childhood friend are all matters spread across the dirt in need of water,
  sunlight, and--most important--your TIME.
\item
  Other GOALS, like your favorite hobbies, or TV shows, take little WORK and
  grow almost anywhere.
\item
  Whether they are dear to you or weeds, if they take your TIME, they are PLANTS
  in your garden.
\item
  Except that they start as seeds.
\item
  And what do you do with seeds to make plants? You garden, dear human, you
  garden.
\item
  All actions toward a plant are according to PLAN.
\item
  All actions toward your SELF are to be considered literal in the garden
  metaphor.
\item
  For example, if you need to eat, or go to the bathroom, you physically go to the
  place and literally do the deed.
\item
  (There will be no pooping on plants, or a pooping plant in this garden.)
\item
  Thus, in the garden you are still a normal human bound to a normal space and
  time, capable of:
  18.1. acting according to bodily need,
  18.2. moving about space, and
  18.3. gardening.
  Today
\item
  Today, you are looking out across the entire garden.
\item
  What has already been planted? What will you add and how much TIME will you
  devote to those GOALS?
\item
  Every seed you plant -- even an abstract one like passing a course or making a
  friend-- implies things in and out of your control like WORK and weather, or
  beyond your awareness, like what your boss loses sleep over.
\item
  Meditate on the final products of your garden.
\item
  Is there a more important plant that deserves your TIME today?
\item
  Meditate on the priorities of your WORK. Do two plants grow better when
  together?
\item
  Make a quick and accurate assessment, but don't sit here all morning thinking
  about it.
\item
  A garden is for working in, to get the FOOD and CAKE you need.
\item
  What do you need to cultivate, today?
\item
  What do you want to cultivate in this life?
\item
  First, you want what your body and mind best respond to. Many of these seeds
  will be obvious.
\item
  It is up to you how curious you are for what better life is possible.
\item
  The day is too short to try everything, and many things are not worth trying.
\item
  There is not always harm to planting something that does not grow, but
  sometimes there is.
\item
  You could run out of space, TIME, or energy that could have been devoted to

\item
  A GOAL names an ideal future reality, comprises a PLAN to increase its
  likelihood, associated with CHUD.
\item
  These three things encompass all cognitive activity related to reality.
\item
  Call anything that could be true, but isn't right now, a GOAL, and any effort in support of making it true a PLAN.
\item
  It is \emph{your} GOAL if you aim to increase its probability of being true.
\item
  A GOAL can be finite or persistent, singular or recurring, or realistic or not.
\item
  If you will need to do something before it is in your hand, it requires a PLAN.
\item
  A PLAN is any combination of WORDS where the writing or reading of them aims
  to improve the chance or decrease the COST of achieving your GOAL.
\item
  Most PLANS are instructions (INSTR) for learning, making, changing, reminding.
  45.1. Product INSTR are a PLAN to maximize satisfaction and minimize liability.
  45.2. For example, lamp INSTR will likely suggest not to put it in water.
\item
  A DOC is a PLAN for GOALS to complete a linguistic product
  46.1. Example DOCs include a resume or epitaph on a tombstone.
\item
  LESSONS are a PLAN template for thinking.
  47.1. Read and complete LESSON steps in order.
\item
  TOOLS are physical or mental objects that help you accomplish your GOAL.
\item
  What is materially required--muscle energy, cash, brain power--is COST.
\item
  All COSTS can be reduced to TIME.
\item
  COST is any action that has a direct exchange.
\item
  COSTS often are secondary objectives within a PLAN.

  For example, you might buy a TOOL (COST).

  In your garden you have the seeds and sprouts of the best you could want, and the most important of what you need.
\item
  There are two important things to keep in mind, however clear things may seem right now.\\
\item
  The first is to always leave room for your goals to change, if and when you achieve them. Think of what you can grow from the seeds of the best apple in your crop.
\item
  The second is that much of what you could achieve, you won't, before the day is over, nor before you die.
\item
  Before there was a garden, you lived as if you wouldn't die. At least some of your GOALs assume \emph{tomorrow} is a good time to start.\\
\item
  I did, at least. The list of my GOALS grew like a wild vine and I found myself
  overwhelmed by what else I wanted, and yet an inability to equalize various
  goals.
\item
  The very difficult task of your priorities, at their core, is to establish the optimal intersection of finite time and infinite, ever-changing desire.
\item
  For example, sleep. About 4 hours daily is a vital priority for everyone (FOOD), but sleeping in on the weekends is usually not (CAKE).
\item
  In your garden, you are limited in what you can do in one day, and in one lifetime.
\item
  Even if you build machines to work fields that stretch out to the horizons,
\item
  you can only eat so much in a day and a lifetime.
\item
  How do you most want to spend your time?
\item
  If your GOAL is to obtain something you do not yet have and have never
  tasted, be careful. It may not satisfy you how you imagine.
\item
  Suppose your goal takes 300 hours of labor.
\item
  You might spend 10 years accruing the time on task, or immerse yourself
  and achieve your GOAL in under 1 year.
\item
  Any true GOAL has a specific optimal deadline.
\item
  Today, you grow the best apple you can,
\item
  yet having tasted it, you might discover a more refined GOAL is closer to
  your heart.
\item
  Whether this apple is FOOD or CAKE, the more you align with yourself, the
  more you will see your GOALS differently than you first conceived of them.

You still ask, ``Why a garden?'' To see one more sense of value, consider what uses the following suggestion has for you. If still it leaves you unsatisfied, you should know enough to give up this book.
Let's pretend your garden is the size of a football field. On one side of your garden instead of yardlines: 0 yards near one goalpost is when you wake, and the opponent's goalpost is when you sleep. Each of your priorities occupies a tiny strip of this span, from endline to endline, so that all your priorities make for a rectangle of long strips. Assuming you MUST move from wake to sleep, how many times during the day, the week, your life, do you dart from strip to strip, juggling 5, 12 priorities, and pretending you are ``multi-tasking''? How much time is merely the management of this juggling, let alone whatever successes you gain from being IN the respective priority's plot on your garden? If you are ready to work, study your calendar, and figure out how to make blocks of time for each priority more systematic, routine, and thus less juggling and wasted management of task-switching.

\hypertarget{calendar}{%
\subsection{calendar}\label{calendar}}

When the focus to what helps you achieve your goals is an object that facilitates action, and not your ability to do an action per se, we might as well just talk about that thing: a tool. This includes a hammer and a calendar. At its core, a calendar is a journal with specific expectations about what you include. Those specifics are up to you to adhere to, but doing so is a great benefit to your PRIs.
How much time it takes to complete goals is part of every bet. A calendar can be a record of every BET. A calendar improves the more you rely on it. Like your HOME, keep your calendar clean.
What goes on a calendar?
1. Events you plan to attend.
2. Events you haven't decided on yet, such as invitations.
3. Deadlines, such as R.S.V.P.s
4. Eating time.
5. ``Maybe'' events.
6. Tasks with details like duration and people involved.
7. Every action associated with a time or range of times.

\hypertarget{risk.}{%
\subsection{Risk.}\label{risk.}}

So what-q
Without a calendar you grossly underestimate the amount of time needed for your GOALS.You forget to prepare for an action, recover from an action and/or transition to another action. For example, going to the grocery store requires time to get (and make) a list, putting on coat and shoes, assembling travel gear (keys or bike helmet), time to put away groceries, and transition.
Consolidate. Use one organized calendar with a system to differentiate classes of BETS (SELF, PPL, WORK, VALUES), just as a HOME handles many actions in different rooms.

For example, take these background facts, which contains the basis of our desired REF.
1- I woke at 8:30AM
2- I wanted to sleep until 9:30AM.
3- In my 9:00AM appointment with you, as you are talking, I yawn.
4- You say, ``I must be boring you.''
5- I want to hear what you were going to say (COMM-PRI).

Each of these (below) are slightly different REFs based on the facts (above), ranked by GOOD-REF:
1-You're not, please continue.
2-No, I'm tired.
3-No, I woke early.
4-Don't make assumptions.
5-I'm not.
6-``I woke at 8:30AM, but wanted to sleep until 9:30AM, so I think I yawned because I am tired.''
7-``I yawned because I am tired. I can see why you thought I was bored, and I'm sorry.''
x-{[}Nothing{]}

All of the REFs above combined suggest the ``IT'' you want to convey. A GOOD-REF is the one that uses truth to focus and advance the COMM-PRI. Below are the REF attributes that make each choice unique (and less GOOD).
1-Give a simple reason to return to the COMM-PRI (example 1 above).
2-Does not add to COMM-PRI nor return to it.
3-`early' may not be true.
4-Focus on others' mistake and issue a command.
5-Begs the question.
6-Focus on the distraction.
7-Focus on the distraction AND makes the same kind of REF which the other did and which caused the confusion.
x-This can be anywhere in the list including 1, depending on what you DO or SAY next.
1-If you or the other return to COMM-PRI without ever returning to this interruption.
4-If it reduces the number of words said before returning to COMM-PRI.
8-If the distraction is remembered, and mentioned again, later.

LET this characterize the problem and approach, and I will end with a few primary objectives, besides.

1.GOOD-REF is a plain IDEA or LINK.
2.If ``GOOD-REF'', the IDEA, crosses your mind while considering what to say, likely that it is a LINK.
3.DECIDE and SAY REF within a few seconds, rather than THINKING more, unless the BET is obvious and worthwhile. BEST-REF is possible, but requires extra THINKING to know the valuable cause. This is not practical, so we go for conservative GOOD-REF.
4.In USE, this means quickly NAME the relevant LINKs, and estimate the central or critical LINK between them.

In our example of the facts, above,
1. 1 is not obvious and adds little to 3.
2. 5 is the COMM-PRI, and 4 is the cause, but not IT in what you say.
3. 2 and 3 are IT, and specifically, the LINK between them.

In a DOC, PAR is a GROUPED set of WORDs roughly equivalent to a complex sentence. It has a primary subject and predicate, and includes any immediately relevant branches from either. In practice it is between 1 and 4 clauses.

GOOD PAR successfully denotes a LINK between two IDEAs, with the following FORM:
1. a syntactic tree, where\\
2. {[}newline{]} is the right path in a fork,\\
3. first indent ('' -``) is the left path in a fork,\\
- trailing''-'' denotes all subsequent lines
in section are equal childs.\\
4. subsequent newline indents or in-line ``--'' are siblings\\
5. left to right are siblings\\
6. double linebreak ends the local tree.

when word order is a left-to-right walk of
a right-branching syntactic tree,
sentence can be written in lines of random lengths, and
read equally as unambiguously.

1) the pri for the reader. answer: what are the fewest words to help a reader know a topic is irrelevant or truly beneficial?
2) the most similar and relevant concepts to most distinct, rare, and particular to what is being described.
1. the left-most word will be either implied or actual chapter headings. All science that is not directly relevant elsewhere, will fall under PPL-WORK or SELF-HOME. The remaining chapters deal with modes on these basic sources: PRI and ED concern optimizing life. (What about WORD, REVISION, COMM?)
In the example above, PSYCH might fall under SELF-BODY, SELF-HOME, PPL, PPL-WORK.
Here, we are talking about defining links for purposes of reducing ambiguity.
The link is the decision of the sentence that requires the most care. It is simply a bridge, and as such has a basic and plain function.
Named links are ACTIONS.

Over-spelling the IDEAs leaves an empty link, e-``do\ldots(the trash)''

cognitive acts should be engaged in as a pyramid of levels (like food pyramid),
number of tasks (width of level),
e-base of 4 height of 4 (levels)=4 topics on bottom level, 3 on 2nd, 2 on 3rd and 1 on 4th.
where the bottom level is the simplest of tasks, such as
name and or bin,
the next is between order and sort,
then between measure and assemble,
finally between test and use,
until it leaves the pyramid as habit, extinguished, or tasks revised.

For example, assuming a GOAL, make an action plan (BLITZ) constrained by number of tasks by type as follows:
5. SORT
4. NAME, DEF, or MEASURE,
3. MAKE (minimum viable)
2. TEST (EDIT, SIM, REVISE)
1. USE (reliable, helpful)

additional tasks must ``wait'' to be addressed until a task of the same level becomes complete and removed from the pyramid, leaving a slot to be replaced.

This is a letter, because it best conveys my audience. or if none,
then at least which way I'm looking.

I've built a kind of form with many default values and
instructions for describing individual experience.

This is a standardization with the goal of resolving many of the problems of communication we take for granted.

We call it subjectivity, and celebrate it, but subjectivity is also the name for the most crippling social problems, too.

Now you're asking yourself:
Is there a better version of me?
Am I capable of moving toward it?
(trust) Am I ready to? (motivation)
These answers should give you an idea of whether
Skilled Reflection will be for you.
And that's the last of the intrusive thoughts,

communication happens from one being to another,
like the vervet screech that specifically means, ``snake''.
the function is to direct attention to a circumstance of high importance:
sharing information.

while the vervet makes or hears calls about threats of immediate, nearby importance,
the breadth of human communication can direct attention to circumstances of
distant places and times.
- this is an echo of the breadth of attention and information humans engage.
for some reason entangled between information, sharing it, there is subjectivity of importance.
the consequence is ambiguity in the value of a communicative act.

  My PRI: To preserve COMM's inherent value, that humans have information valuable to a listener, which they want to share.
\item
  I mainly encourage people who speak, because wanting to share is more evident than the value itself. To me this is the closest to social value- and thus material benefit to the other side of my interest (next).
\item
  The potentiality of making a dream of a better language, become real.
  Where better is either easier to use given the same benefit or clearer to benefit from given the same difficulty to say and understand it.
\item
  such ease invites noticing and attending to yet better information, and as a result, lives lived longer and more stress free of snakes (i-buddhist rope-v-snake).
\item
  i want you to share this value, but i don't believe you can yet,
\item
  so let us return to how to better use our existing communication:

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item

  \item
    aim to approximate this level of value with the utterance, and especially published recording of, your words.
    with enough people, hopefully, we'll test the potential to intentionally grow language.

  I bet these words are but the first of mine valuable to the systematic improvement of sharing information.

\item
  Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide CAKE.

  COMM is the exchange of WORDS from oneself to another. Other

This is a lesson in curriculum writing.
Imagine a perfect course exists,
designed to teach you
to fulfill your specific ambitions.

What are your top 4 goals for
the next 10 years?
you could work on any part of yourself,
move toward any goal you want.

\hypertarget{task-1.-3m-40w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 1. 3m, 40w.}}{Task 1. 3m, 40w.}}\label{task-1.-3m-40w.}}

list four goals,
Each no longer than 10 words

\hypertarget{task-2.-3m-40w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 2. 3m, 40w.}}{Task 2. 3m, 40w.}}\label{task-2.-3m-40w.}}

Your current program requires things your 10 year plan does not.
Courses impose a number of
conditions on your life:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fixed time: courses
\item
  Variable time: assignments
\item
  Uncertain time: studying
\end{enumerate}

List four objectives, goals, course or program requirements that are
most on your mind right now.
Whether most frustrating, or most critical
to you, even `impress my professor'.

\hypertarget{task-3.-5m-50w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 3. 5m, 50w.}}{Task 3. 5m, 50w.}}\label{task-3.-5m-50w.}}

Spell out the intersection between the two lists.
Think of how each goal in the second list
directly influences (or not) your 10 year
objectives.

Explore the main ways these two lists relate.

For example,
1. If I don't get a B, I won't keep my scholarship, and will have to
get a job which will likely lower all my grades.

\hypertarget{task-4.-15m-100w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 4. 15m, 100w.}}{Task 4. 15m, 100w.}}\label{task-4.-15m-100w.}}

What is the least you can do toward the course requirements and still achieve your long term goals?
Consider cutting the work from list two,
that doesn't overlap with one.

Examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Graphic design is fun but not necessary. I could drop it and
  still graduate.
\item
  If I get a D, I'll still pass, graduate, and be able to start my own
  business.
\end{enumerate}

Add 100 more words to your description.

\hypertarget{task-5.-15m-50w.}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Task 5. 15m, 50w.}}{Task 5. 15m, 50w.}}\label{task-5.-15m-50w.}}

Negotiate ways to make direct progress on your first list while fulfilling the second list.

For example, my personality class requires a term paper.
To align with my business goal, maybe the professor will let me write
on ``personality traits of Entrepreneurs.''

Add up to 50 words, and revise.

\item
  Often you will define experiences by your priorities and immediate
  desires.
\item
  Experiences out of line with your desires are dreaded, and those in
  line with them are eagerly anticipated.
\item
  For example, a college student dreads midterms and anticipates spring
  break. Each are about one weeklong, yet the feeling of TIME passing
  and the motivation to engage with challenges are very different.
\item
  Anticipations can create disappointment, so reduce speculation,
  especially its harmful effects on you.
\item
  Do more of what you like when you most need it, try to appreciate
  what you dread, as it is, including the suffering.
\item
  Task 1. 4m, 50w. List 4 GOALS to accomplish for midterms, before
  spring break
\item
  Task 2. 4m, 50w. List 4 GOALS for the best spring break you can
  imagine.
\item
  Task 3. 15m, 200w. There are only so many hours in a day. What
  aspects of SELF-care can you incorporate during your midterms to
  improve your sanity, and hopefully your midterm performance?
\item
  We know what happens if you don't. You're staring at your phone;
  you're reading random articles on the internet and wasting TIME.
\item
  Let's take that same honest realism and intentionally PLAN better
  alternatives: instead of garbage breaks, how about spring breaks?
\item
  In what strategic ways can you get a head start on your spring break
  GOALS, as a form of SELF-care and therapy during your marathon of
  midterm WORK?
\item
  Write out your midterm GOALS with SELF-care and/or spring break
  strategically built in.
\item
  Task 4. 15m, 200w. Now imagine that spring break more fully. You're
  spending TIME on one of your GOALS, when suddenly you remember
  something, you need to do for midterms.
\item
  Maybe you get an email from your instructor or boss, or there's a
  project that looms large.
\item
  What are you going to do to be okay with this intrusion? Would it help
  to allow some TIME to WORK on it, or is it vital that you embrace your
  needs and resist any urge to do WORK?
  65.1. Regardless of how you might ideally respond, PLAN for SELF-
  compassion for when you might unexpectedly struggle
  emotionally.
  65.2. Write out your spring break GOALS with midterm GOALS
  incorporated.

\hypertarget{self-testing}{%
\chapter{``Self-testing''}\label{self-testing}}

All of this book is a lesson in simulation,
because this is a book with words in it,
and words are simulations of reality.
This lesson is an exercise to fearlessly
take action. Since you'll be writing,
it works better if the ``action'' to take is,
itself, a writing task.
It could be an upcoming exam, or writing your will.
The exercise works whether you are
75\% done or 5\% prepared to start.

\textbf{Task 1. 3m, 40w.}

Think about the challenging task you've identified.
Finish a sentence like this:
``The purpose of this task is to\ldots{}''
Perhaps ``demonstrate my knowledge of the endocrine system,'' or
``communicate my values and divvy up my valuables.''

So that I don't continue to prime your death, the remainder of this lesson will focus on the youthful experience of learning.

\textbf{Task 2. 2m, 0w.}

Picture someone who doesn't struggle to do this task.
They would score 100\% or write the perfect paper/assignment.
Assume they weren't born able to do this.
How did they get that skill?
Edit the same 4 things to try to make them more concrete and tractable.

\textbf{Task 3. 8m, 100w.}

Assume that ideal performer writes a custom quiz on
the very areas you're struggling with.
Write quiz questions that tests your learning objectives.
For example, I'm working on a paper that deals with
how talking happens in the brain.
A question in my quiz is, ``define the two contrasting theoretical
positions in 15 words, each.''

\textbf{Task 4. 2m, 0w.}

Revise your quiz so that it would take about 30 minutes for your expert to complete, with questions that can be answered in 5 to 25 words.
Add word and time limits for each question.

\textbf{Task 5. 20-25m.}

Take your quiz.
