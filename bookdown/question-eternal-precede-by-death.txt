eternal question
precedes
death of question

what is the ultimate questions
we will establish these,
but we know they arrive in a space of eternity,
like as follows

all questions say,
"think".

## death
as compliment,
all words can be seen as an answer to this question.
and so 

suppose, since questions can be revised
to their superlatives,
we don't bother to ask them,
knowing they are implied with all answers.

and we do so also to liberate the basic potential for revision.
