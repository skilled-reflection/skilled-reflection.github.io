## You

You and I:

    0.  **Introduction.** This book is centered on you, the specific reader that you are aware is currently reading. I am the one writing.
    1.  **SELF.** For now, focus on applying these words to your actual [SELF][SELF], and determining exactly what or who that is.
    2.  **PRI.** Identify and own your [PRIs][Priorities] before you die.
    3.  **PPL.** You are not all the other imagined readers. Perhaps they are [PPL][PPL]. You will be too, but not yet.
    4.  **BET.** First you'll [BET][BET] about who you (think you) are, until you get sick of losing.
    5.  **Education.** At that point you should become [a STUDENT][Education] of better methods.
    6.  **WORDs.** As a STUDENT you'll simulate methods efficiently with [WORDs].
    7.  **Revision.** You want an answer to the same questions (below) as the rest. [Revise][Revisions] your WORDs until they are uniquely you.
    8.  **COMM.** Then you may contextualize and [communicate][Communication] who you are among PPL.  
    
Until then, you and I and they are all the same.

## Questions

## Terms  

A book with defined terms is a book for humans.
The following list describes the critical concepts that this book deals with and by impliciation, what it does not deal with.
After each definition is a link to its primary context in the book.

## Draft  

This is an early copy of Skilled Reflection, and much of it is still in development. 
Thank you for your patience. 
I welcome any and all constructive feedback ([skilledreflection\@gmail.com](mailto:skilledreflection@gmail.com){.email}). 
Check back later for a revised and updated version.


## Version  

When I first embarked on writing Skilled Reflection (SR), I immediately faced a deceptively simple problem: the order in which to present the content for effective learning and clarity. 
In the first version of this book, I chose to focus solely on defining the system of thought, temporarily ignoring the issue of structure. 
Version 2 attempted to rectify this by introducing a unified framework called "the Garden," initially presented in Version 1. 
Nevertheless, Version 2 remains a prototype in this regard. 
As I begin work on Version 3, I can't guarantee its completion, but elements of it already exist within this text. Don't wait; discover them now.

## Dear 

If you're reading this, it's because you're prepared to engage with your life meaningfully. 
You are going to die someday. 
The finite nature of our existence gives us something valuable to optimize: our time. 
This book aims to help you understand your life and take immediate action.

## Test  

Grab a pencil and jot down the current date and time. 
The concepts in this book come alive only when applied to your life. 
If you followed this instruction, it shows you're open to new ideas and ready to grow. 
If not, ask yourself if you're genuinely open to change and either complete the task or get on with your life.

## Game  

Every word we utter is essentially a blueprint for action, which holds no value unless acted upon. 
Instead of overanalyzing each word or plan, focus on determining your next life moves.  

## Camp  

This book offers straightforward life truths as a solution to today's complexities. 
The relevance of these truths will become evident as you actively engage with them. 
Consider, for example, a camping trip.

  1. Note the expected arrival time on a clock.
  2. You'll likely arrive over-prepared, under-prepared, or 1-3 hours late.
  3. Or you could be an experienced camper.

  
In any case, think of this as your one-time camping trip called "life." 
Chances are, you're running late. 
This book aims to end the distractions and excuses we create to avoid facing this fact. 

## Pitch  {#intro-pitch}

Understanding this book demands reconciling the disconnect between your mental concept of time and actual time.
If you fail, you will die in two worlds: the one you imagine and the one you live.
You, however, would like to ace your own life.
Part one of this book, "the Garden," offers general answers and tools tailored to your needs. 
Part two focuses on how to refine these tools.

## Eat  

This book won't draw the line between need and want for you. 
Here, **food** refers to needs and **cake** to wants. 
Learn to differentiate the two until it's instinctive. 
Then, decision-making becomes straightforward:


    1. If hungry, eat food.
    2. If full, prepare and pack food.
    3. If time permits, eat or prepare cake.

Don't confuse cake with food.  

## Food  

Act, don't think. 
You may think this is a philosophical discourse, but it's not. 
Understanding the difference between food and cake comes from experience, not armchair reflection. 
The best way to overcome this would be to experience homelessness.
Chances are, you aren't homeless. 

Still, you can apply the principles through analogous experiences:  

    1. Lost your car in winter.
    2. Camped without waterproof gear in rain.
    3. Endured weeks of icy showers.
    4. Spent most of two years isolated due to a pandemic.


Your discomfort will demand change. 
Suffering will be: 

    1. Initially terrifying and frustrating.
    2. Easier to bear over time.
    3. Less demanding on your resources, enabling quality cake.  
  

## Overview  {#intro-plan}

The first half introduces a mental model called "the Garden" to counter your mind's idealistic tendencies. 
This prevents you from setting yourself up for failure. 
The second half dives into the key ideas in detail. 

The book concludes with [lessons][zero or one] to identify what's important, problematic, and next. 
They are useful any time and should be revisited. 
Read the relevant sections first to understand the format of [skilled reflection][skilled reflection].

Pay attention to term definitions as they often deviate from common usage. 
For instance, work means "careers," not "yard work." 
These nuances arise from dissecting the food and cake of each idea.
Key terms are in the [index of definitions][index of definitions].
Ideas will also be categorized as "good" or "bad," depending on their relevance to your goals.
