#	BET  

1.	You can't help but think how to make your life better.
2.	You can take control of your life, or you can let the world BET for you. 
You can commit yourself to finding out which thoughts are right or 
leave it to chance to have better life.
3.	A commitment is the first step, but far from the last.
4.	If you want your dreams to become real, listen to your DOUBTs.
5.	Then test them.
6.	Winning means your reality is one step toward your GOAL. 
7.	Losing is the wake-up call to be more realistic.
8.	Betting is a protocol to guide you to reality, and, if you're lucky, your 
dreams might fit in.
9.	How real will your dreams get before you die?

10.	A stranger comes to your garden at the end of a long day, chopping his 
jaw. You look up.
11.	"No really, consider it, right now. Imagine the most realistic, 
attainable, best life you could have. 
12.	Imagine taking the first step and then stay with the thought. Listen to 
the fear that surfaces. 
13.	For the moment, never mind how the world has gotten in your way. 
14.	How are you in your own way?"
15.	He seems to be in your way. He's staring past your wet forehead.
16.	"See your DOUBTs with curiosity. Now BET on what you tell yourself 
you believe. BET on overcoming them."
17.	But you mostly only think of frustration and say, "I appreciate the 
suggestion."
18.	"Let's both BET. Name what you believe you can accomplish 
tomorrow, in terms of what you think holds you back most. 
19.	If you make it happen before sun-up, you'll be over the most daunting 
hurdle between you and your outcome. 
20.	And I'll give you the equivalent of your harvest, today. If you fail, you 
leave me today's harvest."
21.	"Okay," you say. You'll show him.
22.	"The rocks on the far field. They're on a slippery slope. To build the 
home I want, I need those rocks, but I'm afraid of falling. I've collected 
every rock on my land and I need those rocks. Tomorrow I'll finish my 
foundation with rocks from the slippery slope."
BET
23.	A BET is a PLAN template for reconciling REALITY with CHUD, to 
accomplish GOALS.
24.	Betting is confronting costs, habits, UNKNOWNs and DOUBTs that 
stand in the way of your wants and dreams. 
25.	The TIME that passes and the status of your GOAL when it runs out are 
an intersection of reality: the world and you. To name them, is to shed 
CHUD.
26.	Every IDEA you hold is a BET with a rolling deadline, idiosyncratic 
successes, and revisions.
27.	BET wins shorten your PLAN, and the distance to your GOAL. 
Losses should guide revisions to your CHUD.
28.	To BET, name: 
28.1.	a step in your PLAN, 
28.2.	a deadline to achieve it, and 
28.3.	the C.H.U.D. for that duration.
29.	Blitz to revise and win, and log your actions.
30.	When the deadline arrives, take stock. 
30.1.	Compare your action log to your PLAN. 
30.2.	Identify CHUD factors that best explain discrepancies.
30.3.	Revise PLAN, updated with CHUD factor predictions.
30.4.	(Record TIME to do the next BET or GOAL, Revise, etc.)
30.5.	Start the next BET or GOAL.

## Back to the Garden

31.	The next morning you woke to a field in disarray and a letter. You had 
worked harder than you planned, and still fell short of your GOAL. 
32.	"If you did more than you would have without the BET, you won 
something, including evidence that there is some commitment in you 
to make your dreams come true."
33.	The biggest reward is not positive: accept you failed, 
34.	and partly due to a miscalculation. 
35.	Therefore, likely other parts of your PLAN are misguided, and your 
GOAL is further than you estimate.
36.	If you disagree, let's BET again. First, take a minute to learn from your 
planning mistake.

## C.H.U.D. 

37.	Even if you make a PLAN and BET on it, you can fail.
38.	Why don't we achieve our GOALS?
39.	Here are the four critical aspects of success, 
40.	and by extension, clues for why we fail;
41.	CHUD encompasses the changes in you, the world, and your GOAL for 
you to achieve it.
42.	COST ([c2.51][SELF])
43.	HABITS are your dominant tendencies (FORCES). 
43.1.	HABITS are your most likely and reliable FOOD or CAKE actions.
43.2.	Bad HABITS are FORCES working against your GOALS. 
43.3.	Good HABITS are ALIGNED with GOALS.
44.	If you have not arrived at the GOAL, there are UNKNOWNs. 
45.	For example, a train might stop you from arriving on TIME.
46.	From a planning standpoint, UNKNOWNs can be estimated. 
47. Like their conventional meaning, DOUBTs are a form of interference to your PLAN that comes from within.
48.	DOUBTS are predictable failures of estimating Reality, PLANs and UNKNOWNs.
49.	Explore and learn where the line of control is, expand control 
productively, and let go of unhelpful attempts to control.
50.	Good DOUBTS temper an optimistic PLAN. 
51.	Bad DOUBTS fuel bad habits and fantasies.
52.	Fear, anxiety, and jealousy, reflect overestimation of UNKNOWNs. 
53.	Resistance to change due to arrogance and ego reflect 
underestimation of UNKNOWNs.
54.	To be distracted from or bored of your PLAN is
54.1.	 anxiety about your future. 
54.2.	discomfort toward present reality. 
54.3.	distrust in your past.

55.	Most of these issues, if deep enough, require therapy. 
56.	Or the [Intellectual Bootcamp].
