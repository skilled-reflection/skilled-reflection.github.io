### Change your thoughts. Change your life.  

Comprehension is involuntary.
You cannot help but recognize meaning 
if you see or hear language.
This likely means that
your involuntary response
to this section title 
was something like,
"Easier said than done."

Sometimes real meaning requires voluntary thought.
Often, all it takes is a
seemingly incopatible pair
of ideas.
For example,
this time when you
think about the title,
assume it is a reasonable,
serious, 
seriously valuable suggestion.
All it would take is for you
to honestly believe
the answer to the following
questions is, "Yes."  
1.Is there a better version of you?   
2.Are you capable of moving toward it?  
3.Are you ready?
