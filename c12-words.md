## Intro   

This aim of this section
is to transform your existing
concept of using language
--thinking, talking, reading, 
journaling, following a recipe, etc.

It boils down to two key ideas:
**insert fm rm**
words said out loud or written,
and heard, read, or understood are 
usually not what people need, want, or mean.
You benefit from engaging 
the gap between words and reality.

There are benefits of self-betterment:
better ideas, clearer plans and realistic goals,
more effective relationship communication.

or collective: 
clearer idea sharing,
synthesizing, advancing,
learning and teaching.

In turn, how do we 
maximize connection and 
reconcile differences with others?

Perhaps better understanding of self-other
increases compassion and 
relationship quality.

a memory for thousands of words
has biases which influence 
thoughts, and future words.
This is built on cognitive effects
on words, 
words on meaning, belief, and behavior.

This section also 
engages problems of meaning,
communicating,
and how words impact
one's beliefs and behaviors.


It sets up predictions
for how CHUD and why BET
(which are 
beyond the scope of this chapter).

These effects
are each discussed in terms of 
how words can be used 
for the better or worse.

A habit of betting on words
will lead to changed use.

The results presented here are
strong rules
for thinking alone,
saving, revising, 
reading and communicating ideas.

My experience led to these guidelines,
I hypothesize 
predict good language.
Language that helps plans
and the opposite hinders.

The sections 
WORDS, DOCS, SR, COMM, and LIB
are inter-related,
dealing with a shared language problem.
So if the differences are not obvious,
or a point seems out of place,
do not over-think it
(unless you are/want to be a language scientist).

## L10 Simulation Test  
"Self-testing"  

In this lesson, we'll dive into our lives without any planning.   
For this to be effective  
you need a task that gives you some stress, or is something you  
might procrastinate or risk not doing (well).   
It could be studying for an exam, or writing a research paper.  
  
The exercise can apply to a test  
or writing task you haven't started yet,   
or one that you're 75% done with.  
  
**Task 1. 3m, 40w.**  
  
Think about the challenging task you've identified.  
Fill in the blank: "The purpose of this task is to demonstrate my  
knowledge of or ability to \_\_\_\_."  
  
**Task 2. 2m, 0w.**  
  
Picture someone who doesn't struggle to do this task.   
They would score 100% or write the perfect paper/assignment.   
Assume they weren't born able to do this.   
How did they get that skill?   
Edit the same 4 things to try to make them more concrete and tractable.  
  
**Task 3. 8m, 100w.**  
  
Assume that ideal performer writes a custom quiz on   
the very areas you're struggling with.   
Write quiz questions that tests your learning objectives.   
For example, I'm working on a paper that deals with   
how talking happens in the brain.  
A question in my quiz is, "define the two contrasting theoretical  
positions in 15 words, each."   
  
**Task 4. 2m, 0w.**  
  
Revise your quiz so that it would take about 30 minutes for your expert to complete, with questions that can be answered in 5 to 25 words.   
Add word and time limits for each question.   
  
**Task 5. 20-25m.**  
  
Take your quiz. 



## Words 
### DEF
Perhaps more than anywhere else,
the definition of WORD is
critical to making sense of this chapter.

This book deals mainly with
actions and the felt-experience of the world.
Like any book,
this one describes the world
and its conditions with WORDS.

This chapter is about
the act of describing, itself.
Saying WORDS is a very small
physical action, to describe
real actions and consequences.
Hearing and understanding a word
is also a small action,
that engages with WORDS--
a description
about the real world.

The issue is that descriptions
can be more and less right,
more and less helpful.

[](figs/words.png)

### as-hypothetical  
All decision are bets, 
and saying or not saying
a word is a decision.

Words are BETS on hypotheticals:
- truth and reality.
- lies and fantasy.

A PLAN is an arrangement
of WORD BETS.

Words efficiently simulate possible worlds.  
You can think through 
far more situations with words, than 
you can (or should) try in reality.   
Your GOALs can be described in words, and 
words can be easily crossed out and revised.

Good WORDs maximize productivity of thought,
move you beyond pitfalls of CHUD,
direct attention to PRIS, and 
predict reality;
improve decisions and make you smarter.

By thinking about all words you experience,
you can take control
to limit your WORD use 
toward more productive ones,
improving READ and WRITE decisions,    
increasing focus and time for GOALs. 

Bad words keep CHUD expensive,
and are a major culprit of wasted time.  

The COST of an individual word is tiny, but   
we say tens of thousands per day.   
Reading, thinking, saying, and writing   
a word perpetuates that word's IDEA over others,
either moving you toward a GOAL, or your HABIT.   

### IDEAS  
### LINKS  

WORDs are one of two types:   
  
1.  IDEAS: words for things.  
2.  LINKS: words that give relationship between things. 

Together, these make up CONTENT 
(vs STYLE).  

### Alt (theory)
An EXAMPLE is 
an individual, particular 
event or object.

An IDEA is a set of criteria
that LINK EXAMPLES
as similar (vs not).

Good IDEAS 
group EXAMPLES
in a way that
improve PLANS and GOALS.

The most basic IDEA
classifies EXAMPLES as
A or B.
These are alternatives.

All IDEAS and LINKS are WORDS.
All EXAMPLES are reality.
Collections of EXAMPLES are DATA
(to be handled, later).

### NOTES  
improving WORDS
to improve actions
of yourself or others 
is REVISION.
The resulting WORDS are COMM.

NOTES are general PLANs for REVISION,
and what follows is an introduction.
A thorough, generalizable treatment
of writing concisely
is in progress and 
a draft is available on request.


### RECIPE  

A well-formed plan, especially lessons and instructions, 
adhere to a RECIPE format. 
The RECIPE format highlights the IDEAS and LINKS of your  
point, and minimizes excessive STYLE.  
  
1.  List key IDEAS. 

2.  Describe actions and transformations (LINKS). 

### COMM  

COMM deals with the complexity of PPL and WORDs.   
COMM is the exchange of WORDS with other PPL.   

#### Ambiguity 1: PPL
Because PPL vary in PRIs,
they vary in 
how they apprehend the world,
and therefore in precise meanings.

#### Ambiguity 2: COMM
As individuals with distinct PRIs,
there may be distinct, 
potentially conflicting,
motives.
READER and WRITER
will vary in how much they
TRUST COMM.

#### Ambiguity 3: WORDS
WORD definitions
tend to be categorical.
The real world is
particular; 
any experience is an EXAMPLEs.
As such,
the categories from WORDS is always
underspecified for the particulars.
In other WORDS,
GAVAGAI;
words are never definite and certain
in what they describe
--of the real world.

On the other hand,
WORD definitions can match perfectly
with generalizations.
Thus, WORDS are more precise
when hypothesizing (categories).

`x-PRI`
Two people with identical PRIs see the world identically.  
To improve COMM, study the difference
between CONTENT and STYLE.

### DOC  

Studying LINKs will improve 
IDEAs and BETs in your life.  

PLANs, and anything else you write down, 
should be part of a PRI.  

Given an IDEA:  
1.Estimate relevance to 
  - PRIs,   
  - problems, 
  - undeveloped PLANS, 
  - SELF-MAINTENANCE

2.Keep DOCs short enough that   
the title and CONTENT address (only) one thing really well.   
3.Save selectively and   
4.delete frequently. 

### STYLE, VERSION  

PRIs between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
Difference in PRIs alter CONTENT of IDEAs.

Good STYLE is change in WORDs to minimize change in IDEAs
between READER and WRITER.
  
VERSIONs describe identical CONTENT 
with difference in STYLE between them.   

you today vs you in five years (LIB).   

A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of
the (same) final DOC.
  
Some STYLE addresses those who 
fail to appreciate READING and WRITING. 

NORMS (COMM-PPL) typically requires 
editing words to:  
  
1.  Stroke ego and intelligence of others;  
2.  Frame attacks as agreeable observations.  
  
SELF IDEAs are the most STYLE-free. 
e-FOOD and CAKE.

BRAND is
STYLE that intentionally simplifies or obscures relevant  
LINKs to an IDEA. 

## SR

The value of words (meaning)
depends on TIME.
WRITING is for READING.
as TIME passes
DOC becomes subject to COMM issues.

The GOAL of words is to express IDEAs that 
will retain their value tomorrow.   

Work to make IDEAS clear and concrete. 
Put IDEAS at the top of a DOC.   
Provide just enough CONTEXT. 
to remember the basis of the key IDEAs.   
  
Precision depends on purpose.   

LINKS are BETS of 
higher risk and reward than IDEAS.   
  
The right LINK between IDEAs is 
the foundation of every thought, 
recipe or terrible calculation.   

IDEAs are BETs on LINKs 
between EXAMPLEs in the world.   

1.  LIST. Name relevant IDEAs for GOAL.  
2.  WRITE a PLAN, (ordered LINKS).
3.  DOUBT. Assert the strongest rebuttal to the PLAN.  
4.  BET. Improve IDEAS and LINKS 
      by addressing weakness and clarity.  
5.  READ. Wager its value (e.g. relative to another PLAN).

Always reflect to address the question,  
How can I help my future self?  
and impose time and word limits.  
  
A bad doc begins with 
stream-of-consciousness.

#### PROMPTS    
Prompts elicit conflicts (truth) 
between SELF and NORM, 
to improve PLANS for your GOALS. 
TIME and WORD limits work  
together to encourage a balance 
between reflecting on truth and describing it.  

### WORD_CT

DOCs revisited and revised later are 
better with fewer words. 

Word limits combat needless words and  
distracting tangents.  
A word limit keeps your attention.  

Try to write the exact number of words. 
Good word limits require  
cutting out unhelpful words,
change figurative words to concrete, 
ideally assertive and falsifiable.

A DOC's word count is a proxy for 
its complexity; 

PLAN-
For every PLAN you make:   
Assert a word limit before writing, 
to be reminded of your initial intentions, and
be challenged to express IDEAs clearly.
Become skilled at using only the fewest words necessary, 
to reveal and clarify VALUEs.  

If you exceed the limit and 
there is no end in sight, 
stop and reassess.   


#### TIME_LT
The **time limit** dictates 
how precise your words should be. 
Extra  time is for better words. 
For example, a one-minute, 50-word limit 
(1m, 50w) 
encourages free writing 
with minimal restrictions on quality of thought.  
Conversely, a 4-minute, 40-word limit 
(4m, 40w) 
is meant to encourage  
more careful selection of words.  

#### LESSONS-SR  
LESSONS are an ordered set of prompts, 
usually three to four, 
up to 60 minutes and 250 words. 
A prompt's word count is the number  
of words to be added to your document.  

Note: 
A 0w prompt means revise, but 
do not increase the word total.

The first prompts in LESSONS are 
warm-ups to direct your attention. 
They ask for names of IDEAS. 
  
The next prompts are for thinking, 
requiring you to make LINKS between  
your warm-up IDEAS. 
Done right, 
you will face some new truths. 

### REVISE  
REVISION is how we know reflection is happening, described here in  
VERSIONS (v\#) of a response. 

EXAMPLE: 
What caused this reaction? 
  
Response-v1:  
  
1.  I work hard on an intellectual activity.  
2.  I'm not secure about it.  
3.  Someone I admire undermines it.  
  
Response-v2:  
  
1.  I make something I think is well done.  
2.  I expect validation.   
3.  Criticism catches me off guard.  

Version 1 is less generalizable. 
Version 2 is more plain and verifiable, 
making it more useful for PLANs.  
  
You may also revise answers to prior prompts, but   
only to keep up with or   
help address the current prompt.  

**Revise the prompt.**   
The prompts encourage reflection,  
but truth-seeking defines the prompt. 

While reflecting you may uncover  
truths less relevant to the prompt than to your GOALS.   
Revise the prompt  
in a way that best promotes development of the insight at hand.   
This may be toward the end, or on the first prompt.   
For example,   
a prompt referring to University student experiences   
should be adapted for your  
non-University experiences.  
  
Prompts can also be "irrelevant" 
if they are too emotionally overwhelming,   
for critical thinking. 

Do not change the prompt so you can be lazy.  
  
#### SAVE-if (LIB)  
RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDs is easier than   
RETRIEVAL from memory, of WORDs to write.   
is-an IDEA-REVISION SAVINGs.

Lessons are only valuable for the insights  
that will make tomorrow helpful.   
Lessons are designed to be  
revised over time.  

Only save and maintain DOCs that 
will be useful enough later  
to save time, overall.

Facilitate RETRIEVAL:
5.Index (list) DOCs worth rereading.
6.Assign a number that indicates its relative  
importance (abs or relative weight). 
6.Add tags and metadata for easier sorting. 
7.Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s).  
  Record and study LIB RETRIEVAL patterns. 

### LIB  
The collection of your WORDs over a lifetime.   

A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.
`Library = sum(GOALS + PLANS) / 1`  
for learning what you don't know you don't know.
A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation.
  
vs-whereas WORDS deals with involuntary IDEAs,
LIB is post-WRITING cache 
to facilitate future production.

RISKs  
1.FALSE POSITIVE: Writing and saving and finding bad DOCs.
2.FALSE NEG: failure to save and find good DOCs.


## Plans

### SELF
speak the truth or shut up.  
Use them for decisions, not emotions.   
Use to facilitate your life PLAN and 
stop talking for other reasons.  "

### PPL
Do not use a word that is more of a Lie

assert boundaries against 
exaggerated words or
unreliable time (scheduling)


### NOTES  
Add structural consistency to make LINKS more explicit.
edit/apply these techniques as a form of active READING.

## Lesson: 0 or 1
As a human you are endowed with words.
Too much, so.
For a moment, forget those words.

Please answer each question with "0" or "1".   
Do not dwell on any one question.  
  
1.  Which are you: 0 or 1?  
2.  If the person who knew you best guessed your answer,  
    what would they report? 0 or 1?  
3.  What would you tell them you are?  
4.  What would the last dog you encountered say you are?  
  
How do you feel about   
5.  lunch today?  
6.  the chair you are sitting in?  
7.  your fingers?  
  
8.  Where do you live?  
9.  When were you born?  
10. What makes this question so simple that you can answer it  
    with 0 or 1?  
11. Is lying, or hoping, or reminiscing 0, or 1?  
12. Have you been telling the truth to these questions?  
13. Are you honest with yourself?  
  
14. Are you here?  
15. Do you know?  
16. How do you know?  
17. What would it look like if you didn't know?  
18. What if you *don't know* if you know?  
  
19. What are you certain of?  
20. Is this annoying or interesting?  
21. Are you ready to use words, yet?  
  
22. Imagine you didn't know of language beyond 0 or 1.    
    You didn't know a deeper connection with others was possible.  
    The chance to respond to the following question is   
    your 15 minutes of fame to the universe.   
    What is your one bit of say,   
    written on the ledger next to your existence, or   
    on your tombstone: 0 or 1?  
  
23. What's your average score? 0 or 1?  
24. Has this been insightful?  
  
If you wrote 1 for 24, congratulations.
