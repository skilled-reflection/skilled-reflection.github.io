Do not write PLANs you won't follow.
Read to revise plans into ones you'd follow.

## Intro
 
There are two key ideas in this chapter:
words said (out loud or written),
and understood (heard or read) are
usually not what people mean.
They do not reflect what people want or need.

The gap between reality and
idea is only narrowed with systematic scrutiny,
the process of BET (Chapter 6).

By engaging
the gap between words and reality,
you increase self-awareness.

Better words mean
more practical understanding and expectations,
more complete desires, and the capacity
to make a concrete plan for achieving your goals.
This will naturally include
healthier communication and
more rewarding relationships.

A community with better words has
clearer idea sharing,
synthesizing, developing,
teaching and learning.

## Cognition

Speaking your mind is difficult.
A memory system dealing with language
is tasked to
translate thoughts into
the right words from thousands.
It is prone to inaccuracies.

Similarly, a listener 
focused on comprehending,
is not likely to monitor 
all the incidental priming effects
of words on a memory system.
Words said and words heard 
have a latent impact on
one's beliefs and behaviors.

These effects
are each discussed in terms of
how words can be used
for the better or worse.

A habit of betting on words
will lead to changed use.

The result of such bets are
this book, and this chapter:
strong rules
for thinking alone,
saving, revising,
reading and communicating ideas.

My experience led to these guidelines,
which I hypothesize
predict good language.

The sections
WORDS, DOCS, SR, COMM, and LIB
are inter-related,
dealing with a shared language problem.

## Words
### DEF
Perhaps more than anywhere else,
the definition of WORD is
critical to making sense of this chapter.

This book deals mainly with
actions and the felt-experience of the world.
Like any book,
this one describes the world
and its conditions with WORDS.

This chapter is about
the act of describing, itself.
Saying WORDS is a very small
physical action, to describe
real actions and consequences.
Hearing and understanding a word
is also a small action,
that engages with WORDS--
a description
about the real world.

The issue is that descriptions
can be more and less right,
more and less helpful.

### as-hypothetical
All decision are bets,
and saying or not saying
a word is a decision.

Words are BETS on hypotheticals:
- truth and reality.
- lies and fantasy.

A PLAN is an arrangement
of WORD BETS.

Words efficiently simulate possible worlds.
You can think through
far more situations with words, than
you can (or should) try in reality.
Your GOALs can be described in words, and
words can be easily crossed out and revised.

Good WORDs maximize productivity of thought,
move you beyond pitfalls of CHUD,
direct attention to PRIS, and
predict reality;
improve decisions and make you smarter.

By thinking about all words you experience,
you can take control
to limit your WORD use
toward more productive ones,
improving READ and WRITE decisions,
increasing focus and time for GOALs.

Bad words keep CHUD expensive,
and are a major culprit of wasted time.

The COST of an individual word is tiny, but
we say tens of thousands per day.
Reading, thinking, saying, and writing
a word perpetuates that word's IDEA over others,
either moving you toward a GOAL, or your HABIT.

### Plans
Do not use a word that is more of a Lie
say the truth or be quiet.
Use words for decisions, not emotions.
Use to facilitate your life PLAN.
stop talking for other reasons.

Choose what you listen to:
assert boundaries against
exaggerated words or
unreliable ones.

### IDEAS
### LINKS  

WORDs are one of two types:
 
1.  IDEAS: words for things.
2.  LINKS: words that give relationship between things; actions and transformations

Together, these make up CONTENT
(vs STYLE).

LINKS are BETS of
higher risk and reward than IDEAS.

IDEAs are BETs on LINKs
between EXAMPLEs in the world.
 
The right LINK between IDEAs is
the foundation of every thought,
recipe or terrible calculation.

### Alt (theory)
An EXAMPLE is
an individual, particular
event or object.

An IDEA is a set of criteria
that LINK EXAMPLES
as similar (vs not).

The most basic IDEA
classifies EXAMPLES as
A or B.
These are alternatives.

Good IDEAS
group EXAMPLES
in a way that
improve PLANS and GOALS.

All IDEAS and LINKS are WORDS.
All EXAMPLES are reality.
Collections of EXAMPLES are DATA
(a topic for later).

### NOTES
improving WORDS
to improve actions
of yourself or others
is REVISION.
The resulting WORDS are COMM.

NOTES are general PLANs for REVISION,
and what follows is an introduction.
(A full draft is available on request.)

Add structural consistency to make LINKS more explicit.
edit/apply these techniques as a form of active READING.

### RECIPE

A well-formed plan, especially lessons and instructions,
adhere to a RECIPE format.
The RECIPE format highlights the IDEAS and LINKS of your
point, and minimizes excessive STYLE.
 
1.  List key IDEAS.  
2.  Describe actions and transformations (LINKS).

## manifesto  

If you an informed STUDENT,
then you will arrive at the following
principles of knowledge, language, and action.

### better language / world  

Distrust words and ego.
- Take nothing personally
- Define everything empirically
  - comparison group/quantity (has unique outcome)
- Remove / ignore style
- Speak for reasons only
- Idea > authorship (anonymity)
- Read to refine beliefs and doubts.
- Write to bet.

#### speak   
Speak, write, initiate or respond only

in limited duration and words
dictated by intended outcome.

Do not at all
when actions or listening 
are needed.

#### listen  
listen / read
be with

when you need to learn / connect
- limited in duration/words needed
- to assess consent (agreement).

not when
- speaking values unadhered

#### repair  
when listening to invalid speech,
after--repair
1m-gently with gestures  
2m-briefly and clearly with words  
3m-firmly with boundaries  
5m-civilly end conversation and walk away.  


#### dialog / revise / anon  
write what you bet  
revise toward truth  
- to max others' bets

radical anti-ownership of ideas  
- edit for anyone with the authority of your autobiography  
- for the benefit of the OP  
- expecting only feedback  

### actions  
commit values to bets  
- self + calling > cakes  
- idea > xref  
- bet > fact > belief > word  
- action > money > words > thoughts  

solutions to problems  
- remove problem src or self from problem.  
- accept that problem comes from other solutions  
- revise those solutions (ie reuse)  
- blitz solution  
- eat, sleep better  
- wake up: cold shower, pint of water, work out, deaf/blind hour, spend time with an ugly person  

minimalism; align, revise and keep fit  
- keep only hf things in smallest box possible  
- keep clean  
- keep routine (self) needs minimal  
  - stuff, expectations, plans (movement)  

### actions  
"if" requires an action argument.  
- (tethering hypotheticals)
