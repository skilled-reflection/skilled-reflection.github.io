## Lesson: Self  

### Focus
A perfect human is one
who sees their destination
as clear as the sun on the horizon,
able-bodied to get there.

This framework considers
two interrelated ideals:
a FIT self with WIT.

Your intention is to be FIT for 
the actions your body and the world requires,
and WIT to decide what's required,
and act accordingly.

### Attention  
Everything is meant plainly.   
simply pay attention.   

If you get confused, forget it, 
pay attention to right now.  
  
### Thinking  

Our goal here is thinking.   
Thinking happens in your heads.   
In order to do something about it,   
we need to think on paper.  
  
### Time  

You'll get good at thinking.
[but not because of your attention]

attention is not reliable.   
The clock is. 
The clock is a cue to think.  
When it goes off, 
get back on task (pay attention).  
  
### Truth  
READER, there is 
some truth in you,
and some bull.

Much of it you can discern
by paying attention.
focus on the Truth in you.  

Skilled Reflection
will help you improve.

boring or difficult.
As you read this book,
you are listening to me.
You chose to be here.

listening to another person.   

Read to assess your BET on 
whether these words reflect TRUTH.
Ask yourself if it is true for:  
1-the author.   
2-you. Ask yourself how you saw the world before,  
and after reading.   
3-others. Ask if this generalizes to others.
