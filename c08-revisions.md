## SR

The value of words (meaning)
changes over TIME,
because the READER's
values change over TIME (x-COMM).

The GOAL of words is to express IDEAs that
at least retain today's value,
at best maximize tomorrow's value.
Since few words meet these criteria,
your first benchmark is to write few words.

Work to make IDEAS clear and concrete.
Put IDEAS at the top of a DOC.
Provide just enough CONTEXT
to remember the basis of the key IDEAs.
 
Precision depends on purpose.

1.  LIST. Name relevant IDEAs for GOAL.
2.  WRITE a PLAN, (ordered LINKS).
3.  DOUBT. Assert the strongest rebuttal to the PLAN.
4.  BET. Improve IDEAS and LINKS
      by addressing weakness and clarity.
5.  READ. Wager its value (e.g. relative to another PLAN).

Always reflect to address the question,
How can I help my future self?
and impose time and word limits.
 
A bad doc begins with
stream-of-consciousness.

### PROMPTS
Prompts elicit conflicts (truth)
between SELF and NORM,
to improve PLANS for your GOALS.
TIME and WORD limits work
together to encourage a balance
between reflecting on truth and describing it.

### WORD_CT

DOCs revisited and revised later are
better with fewer words.

Word limits combat needless words and
distracting tangents.
A word limit keeps your attention.

Try to write the exact number of words.
Good word limits require
cutting out unhelpful words,
change figurative words to concrete,
ideally assertive and falsifiable.

A DOC's word count is a proxy for
its complexity;

PLAN-
For every PLAN you make:
Assert a word limit before writing,
to be reminded of your initial intentions, and
be challenged to express IDEAs clearly.
Become skilled at using only the fewest words necessary,
to reveal and clarify VALUEs.

If you exceed the limit and
there is no end in sight,
stop and reassess.


#### TIME_LT
The **time limit** dictates
how precise your words should be.
Extra  time is for better words.
For example, a one-minute, 50-word limit
(1m, 50w)
encourages free writing
with minimal restrictions on quality of thought.
Conversely, a 4-minute, 40-word limit
(4m, 40w)
is meant to encourage
more careful selection of words.

#### LESSONS-SR
LESSONS are an ordered set of prompts,
usually three to four,
up to 60 minutes and 250 words.
A prompt's word count is the number
of words to be added to your document.

Note:
A 0w prompt means revise, but
do not increase the word total.

The first prompts in LESSONS are
warm-ups to direct your attention.
They ask for names of IDEAS.
 
The next prompts are for thinking,
requiring you to make LINKS between
your warm-up IDEAS.
Done right,
you will face some new truths.

### REVISE
improving WORDS
to improve actions
of yourself or others
is REVISION.

REVISION is how we know reflection is happening,
described here in
VERSIONS (v\#) of a response.

EXAMPLE:
What caused this reaction?
 
Response-v1:
 
1.  I work hard on an intellectual activity.
2.  I'm not secure about it.
3.  Someone I admire undermines it.
 
Response-v2:
 
1.  I make something I think is well done.
2.  I expect validation.
3.  Criticism catches me off guard.

Version 1 is less generalizable.
Version 2 is more plain and verifiable,
making it more useful for PLANs.
 
You may also revise answers to prior prompts, but
only to keep up with or
help address the current prompt.

**Revise the prompt.**
The prompts encourage reflection,
but truth-seeking defines the prompt.

While reflecting you may uncover
truths less relevant to the prompt than to your GOALS.
Revise the prompt
in a way that best promotes development of the insight at hand.
This may be toward the end, or on the first prompt.
For example,
a prompt referring to University student experiences
should be adapted for your
non-University experiences.
 
Prompts can also be "irrelevant"
if they are too emotionally overwhelming,
for critical thinking.

Do not change the prompt so you can be lazy.

#### NOTES
NOTES are general PLANs for REVISION.
(Available on request.)

#### PEER-REVISION 
Peer revision is a powerful learning tool.
Forget *who* provides REVISION and how much. 
Get answers from others.

The peer WRITER 
works with uncompromised objectivity, 
and liberty to employ Truth, 
however subjectively "harsh".


### SAVE
x-LIB
Assuming you have given honest attention and honest work, 
Save your DOC.

RECOGNITION, reading familiar WORDs is easier than
RETRIEVAL from memory, of WORDs to write.
is- SAVINGs on revision.

Lessons are only valuable for the insights
that will make tomorrow helpful.
Lessons are designed to be
revised over time.

Only save DOCs that
you BET will be useful enough later
to save time, overall.



## DOC
A recipe is the ideal DOC template.
Here are additional guidance. 

Given an IDEA:
1.Estimate relevance to
  - PRIs,
  - problems,
  - undeveloped PLANS,
  - SELF-MAINTENANCE

2.Keep DOCs short enough that
the title and CONTENT address 
only one thing.

3.Save selectively and  

4.delete frequently.  

These suggestions are only as valuable as your experience with them. In the next section, COMM,
your goal is to understand how to make the most of your experience with WRITING and READING.

### COMM
Once saved, we assume a DOC will be READ later, and provide value. This is the primary type of COMM we engage in. 

COMM is the exchange of WORDS from one self to another. Other examples include a traffic sign, something you wrote and are rereading,
a carefully crafted party invite, 
or a Lease Agreement.

The goal of COMM is to maximize that likelihood, by engaging in the inherent and practical problems that arise. 

This section, COMM, describes the inherent problem. The next section, STYLE-VERSION describes the practical problem.

The general problem of COMM is the discrepancy between READER and WRITER of the same word. No person is identical with a future or past self, with any other person, and all of these relationships are in part unknown.
Writing a word creates a static record of a word.
The cognition which wrote the word
is under a specific state and intends a specific meaning or value for that word.
At the future time when the word is read,
it is the same static record of a word,
but the cognition reading the word may be different enough to understand a meaning different than intended. Additional words on part of the original writer might be added to attempt to minimize unintended interpretation on part of the reader. Additionally, the reader may apply an additional interpretation attempting to reconcile the same problem.

GOOD COMM attempts to systematically reconcile these issues.
BAD COMM takes advantage of them at the cost of clarity and honesty.


#### Ambiguity 1: PPL
Because PPL vary in PRIs,
they vary in
how they apprehend the world,
and therefore in precise meanings.

#### Ambiguity 2: COMM
As individuals with distinct PRIs,
there may be distinct,
potentially conflicting
motives.
READER and WRITER
will vary in how much they
TRUST COMM.

#### Ambiguity 3: WORDS
The real world is
particular;
each experience is an EXAMPLE.
A WORD describes groups of experiences in common,
whether an IDEA or LINK.
As such,
WORDS are always
less precise than reality.

WORDs are never definite and certain
in what they describe
of the real world.

A word's definition is a generalization.
(Thus, WORDS are better designed 
to hypothesize and predict.)

`x-PRI`
Two people with identical PRIs see the world identically.
To improve COMM, study the difference
between CONTENT and STYLE.


### STYLE, VERSION

PRIs between PPL (WRITER and READER) differ.
Difference in PRIs alter CONTENT of IDEAs.

Good STYLE is change in WORDs 
to minimize change in IDEAs
between READER and WRITER.
 
VERSIONs describe identical CONTENT
with difference in STYLE between them.
A PLAN for a DOC is an earlier VERSION of
the (same) final DOC.

e-you today vs you in five years.


COMM-PPL (x-NORMS) assume READING and WRITING
have no intrinsic GOALs.
A DOC's arguments for why to READ it
are a STYLE called PITCH.
For example,
 
1.  Stroke ego and intelligence of others;
2.  Frame attacks as agreeable observations.

The maximum common SELF-PRIs across PPL
are the optimal arguments for PITCH.
e-FOOD vs. CAKE.

However, if PPL do not have a real appreciation for FOOD vs CAKE, 
they will not be pursuaded by PITCH.

Therefore they will be compelled more by lies.
BRAND is PITCH that distorts truth,
a form of bad STYLE.


### LIB-CURATOIN
This book is a DOC among many you have encountered, and you have written many, yourself, even if just a to-do list. LIB is the explicit effort to maximize the use of what you WRITE, SAVE, and READ, by organizing it for best application, and providing feedback to help your future decisions to WRITE, SAVE, and READ. 

The scope of LIB is the collection of your WORDs over a lifetime.
LIB is to DOCs as HOME is to possessions.

LIB aims to maximize the value of words you save,
and ideally, reduce future efforts to plan and accomplish PRIS, through making the best of your prior thoughts easy to find by your current SELF's context.

A bad LIB is the sum of your WORDS, void of curation.

A good LIB is the closest approximation of SELF.

`Library = sum(GOALS + PLANS) / 1`

for learning what you don't know you don't know.
 
vs-whereas WORDS deals with involuntary IDEAs,
LIB is post-WRITING cache
to facilitate future production.

RISKs
1.FALSE POSITIVE: Writing, saving, and finding bad DOCs.
2.FALSE NEG: failure to save or find good DOCs.

### LIB-RETRIEVAL 

Studying LINKs will improve
IDEAs and BETs in your life.

PLANs, and anything else you write down,
should be part of a PRI.

Facilitate RETRIEVAL:
1.Index (list) DOCs worth rereading.
2.Assign a number that indicates its relative
importance (abs or relative weight).
3.Add tags and metadata for easier sorting.
4.Make and revise only for high-PRI GOAL(s).
  Record and study LIB RETRIEVAL patterns.
