## Chapter 1.	Introduction

Note for v2.12. If you are reading this, you have an early copy of the 2nd version of 
this book. This copy is missing a few key sections in addition to other edits which 
remain before making it public. Thank you for your patience in 
misunderstandings. I welcome any and all constructive feedback. Additionally, 
feel free to check back in for a revised and updated version if you please.

Dear me,  

1.	Read this book because you're ready to.
2.	You are going to die someday. This book is for you if there is something in the 
meantime worth maximizing.
3.	Please engage your life. This book is meant to help you break through mental 
barriers, into action, starting right now.
4.	Please get a pencil and note the date and TIME, right now: ______-______ (YYMMDD-HHMM). 
5.	The WORDS in this book are meaningful only when you apply them to your life.
6.	If you wrote the date and time as requested in step 4, you have proven enough to yourself that you are open to trying 
new ideas. You are prepared to grow and continue reading.
7.	If you left the line blank, you might tell yourself you are open to new ideas. You 
will be right when you complete the task. 
8.	Either write the TIME above or stop reading, and take a better action to improve 
your life, right now.
9.	Every WORD you say to yourself is at best a PLAN for action, meaningless until 
you take that action. 
10.	Consider every WORD I write a PLAN to improve your actions.
11.	Reasons for the PLAN are always less important than consequences of following 
them, often omitted. 
12.	What is important will appear, and what isn't will be forgotten. 

### Go Camping  

13.	This book describes obvious facts of life. Very little should surprise you because 
it falls awfully close to reality.
14.	The first way to see this is to consider going on a camping trip, right now.
15.	To make this happen you will likely overpack, be late or unprepared.
16.	Planning and executing your life are not fundamentally different.
17.	Perhaps you are an experienced camper, and you're not unprepared or late to 
camp. 
18.	Unlike camping, we don't have past life experiences. You are very likely late to 
your own life.
19.	The reason is a disconnect between your mind's image of TIME, and the one you 
are physically bound to. 
20.	The result is you will die in two worlds, the world you imagine you could have 
lived, and the one you did. 
21.	Part one, the Garden, is a tool for remedying all the knowable versions of this 
problem.

22.	Now, suppose you are hungry, and you must choose between finding FOOD or 
CAKE. 
23.	FOOD refers to needs and CAKE refers to wants; what really matters, and what 
you can live without.
24.	If you reject this premise, you CAKE hypotheticals more than constructive 
exploration.
25.	To make sure you are on TIME for life, first find the FOOD. Guarantee FOOD is 
thoroughly planned, and first to be packed.
26.	Then, what TIME remains before you need to go (act) is for choosing and 
packing pieces of CAKE.
27.	Now for the bigger issue: How do you decide whether something is FOOD or 
CAKE?
28.	Often, extreme experiences like being homeless or taking a cold shower, 
illuminate the difference between FOOD and CAKE.

### Be homeless

29.	The odds are you haven't been homeless. Therefore, imagine the closest 
experience you've had. 
30.	Perhaps you couldn't find your car in the middle of winter, or you went camping 
without waterproof gear and it rained. 
31.	In the first moments, there is shock and terror, frustration and suffering. Your 
habit protests for a change in PLANS.
32.	In any environment, even far into the spectrum of clear suffering, habits will 
acclimate in TIME. What you call suffering will change.
33.	Part two is a group of guidelines for sharing ideas with the GOAL of identifying 
what matters. 
34.	The key arguments are radical application of brevity, CAKE-assessing, and clarity. 
35.	These are accomplished with concrete guidance on actions. 
The Garden Narrative
36.	The Garden foregrounds the things we often lose sight of when conceptualizing 
life GOALS: life is brief, and we are mortal. 
37.	It is a mental model of reality, designed to bring clarity. 
38.	Your Garden is your GOALS put on key IDEAS of this book.
39.	You need the Garden to combat the other strength of your mind, its inherently 
idealistic nature, which sets you up for failure and suffering.
40.	In these chapters, the second half revisits the key ideas in more formal 
language.
41.	WORDS in all capital letters are IDEAS that have specific definitions that differ 
slightly from conventional use. 
42.	For example, "WORK" is an IDEA referring to "careers", but not 'yard WORK'. 
43.	LESSONS are much like "The Garden", meant to activate relevant parts of your 
reality or beliefs, in a way that applies the IDEAS introduced. 
44.	They are exercises that take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete.
45.	Finally, each unique point made in a chapter is enumerated for easy cross-
referencing. 
46.	An example cross-reference for the item immediately above is as follows: [1.45] 
"1" referring to this chapter, and "45" to the item number.
47.	This will be taken advantage of in future revisions.
