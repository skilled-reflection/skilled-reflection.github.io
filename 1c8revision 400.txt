- revision = version
- semantic degrees
- units of cognitive processing

If writing and reading extend memory, 
revision extends cognition.
The merit of revision is a product of

proportionate to
returning a value vs
returning a function

Revision from draft 1 to final 
can be parallel to
life from literacy til death.

A committment on par with a child born on space ship commits to travelling to alpha centauri.

It literally could, if the child
wrote, say a sentence about their day, as many days as possible while they were alive.
(How many days would that be?
In what way is this a bad goal?
Not just,
what do we bet we'd learn,
worth enough to try,
despite not understanding this?)
(If I alone played this game?
Am I willing to play this game alone?
I hope there's some value to asking myself that
instead of asking a crowd.
