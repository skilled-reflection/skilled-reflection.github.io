Consider the GOAL of describing  
the properties of __apples __ with the purpose of selling them:  
  
v1 (CONTENT): __Apples are healthy but sugary. __  
  
v2 (STYLE): __Apples are tasty and nutritious. __  
  
v3 (BRAND): __Apples are healthy.__  

# overview
The complete account of a person's material life is HABIT. The mind is the difference between actual and perceived HABIT, or, Unknowns. Costs and DOUBTs are the patterns of Habit and Unknown, respectively. 

# CH
Costs and habits are facts. 

## HABIT
The unadjusted, plain record of everything you have physically done, is your HABIT.
The word HABIT pragmatically refers to patterns of behavior. 
For example, I eat every morning before 9 AM.

## COST
The unadjusted plain record of transactions, where you are giver and receiver, is an account of COSTS in your life.
The word COST pragmatically refers to typical transactions for a GOAL token.

For example, a relationship with an alcoholic has a special cost of increased RISK.

Both COST and HABIT have a knowable truth to them.
That is, if independent observers watched and noted your COSTS and HABITS, there would be high agreement between them. 

# Unknowns and Doubts
Your perception may or may not agree with CH, and it is either because of UNKNOWNS, or DOUBTS. Without any additional analysis, the gap between your assumed costs and habits, and true COSTS and HABITS, is due to these two factors. 

## Unknown
The first is a non-judgmental category; equivalent to mathematical "error". 

Unknowns are all that are fully out of your control. What you are able to name or know about an unknown, is equivalent to reducing the unknown in precisely those ways.
For example, I will die, but not know how or when; the cause is unknown. I will die due to a natural disaster or cancer; the cause is named, and the unknown is now: what kind of natural disaster or cancer, and what are those underlying causes.
Naming and estimating cause is the primary way to reduce the unknown. 

## DOUBT
Doubts are a special case of unknowns. They are the deliberate unknowns. Factors which could be controlled better by a human, but HABIT of mind disallows it. This is an error of mind, equivalent to psychological maladaptive or irrational behavior (i-behavioral economics). 
DOUBT is any systematic error that is possible to be addressed by another human of equal ability and resources.
