You care about some things more than others, and 
do some things more than others. 

_Skilled reflection_ is 
an attempt to clarify how your 
actions and 
values 
relate to each other, and 
make clear next-steps toward 
who you imagine yourself being.

There's a book about it [right here](_book/index.html).

[Skilled Reflection](https://win.wisc.edu/organization/skilledreflection) is 
a Student Organization at the University of Wisconsin-Madison that 
meets once a week 
to write privately for about an hour. 

Each session focuses on specific themes related to 
identity, 
goals, and 
being a student, 
with prompts for you to reflect and write on. 

More than anything, the time and writing are commitments to better navigate our complex lives.
