# The IBC
# Intellectual Bootcamp  

## Admissons  
On the computer screen:  

### Information 

This is a boot camp 
whose purpose is to train adults 
to think harder, clearer and more effectively; 
to produce intelligent solutions 
for personal and social puzzles; 
to have a higher cognitive discipline; 
to instill shared values about 
reason, thinking and discourse; and 
to empower.

It is a training program designed to 
break down bad habits of thought,
and build good ones while immersed here,
a culture of rational thinking
isolated from the outside world.

Here you will relentlessly confront
your ideas 
about the world, 
with instructors 
drilling intellectual skills
(writing essays, arguing for ideas, and
developing proposals for action). 

You will be trained to 
move toward your goals with focus,
even in the face of perceptual, physical, or emotional distractions. 
Over time, students could expect to cultivate 
a sharper focus on cognitive objectives, 
resilience to distractions and challenges.
If you graduate,
it will be with the ability 
to identify, develop, and communicate ideal critical,
rational arguments, 
positions or plans (orally or written) given the available knowledge, finite time, and resources at hand 
(reference material, teamwork).   

you will also learn 
a code of behavior for
being a community leader;
collaborating or competing with
an idiosyncratic, irrational world.

The central requirement for applicants will be 
a commitment to better understand 
the self and world. 

### Consent and Commitment   
Hi.  
0.Your name doesn't matter.  
1.Is there a better version of you?  
2.Are you capable of moving toward it?  
3.Are you ready?  

If your answers are yes, then you are a student.
To live a better life,
you will commitment 
to change your actions.
First, you will learn what changes are needed.

# Student  

Students are PPL with
IDEAS from EXPERIENCE toward 
selfish GOALS. 

Lessons depend on 
students' prior knowledge. 

A STUDENT 

1. has a goal that can be better named and planned.
2. requires time away from BETTING.
3. admits not knowing but capable.

Students learn
to represent their knowledge in words;
to prefer better, alternative words.
A student
sees the impersonal as more reliable 
both for selfish GOALS and
social ones. 

A bad student studies 
to avoid action, or 
for its own sake.

A Student WRITES IDEAs and GOALs
to their INSTRUCTOR.

#### Goal 
Your goal is clear. 

You want
1. The strength needed to 
  a. take the right steps and  
  b. make a habit of it,
3. keen eyes to 
  a. estimate the destination and 
  b. correct course, and 
4. a focused mind to steady the foot.


### Agreement  
This is
an in-person immersive experience.

You only really learn
what you need to know
to be who you really want.
You won't learn
unless you cannot escape needing it;
in a dedicated environment 
that fosters acquisition,
minimizes interference.

Whether you're here for 
the 7- or 30-day experience,
you will work hard every minute.


For every minute of lesson on my time,
students are to
provide two minutes of writing,
either toward others' learning or 
in direct application toward their goal.

Dedicate to identity growth. 
Be:  
1.Quiet, except when tasks require verbal response.  
2.Receptive to work and feedback provided by the instructor.  
3.Committed to producing genuinely inspired ideas, working quickly, and seeking   improvement.  
4.Respectful that all are equal in voice, and aim to describe solutions with collective values.  
5.Receptive and responsive to prompts and observations (from peers and/or instructors)  especially CHUD, vague language, and cognitive bias.  
6.Motivated to describe solutions that benefit others, when possible, including peer-review

Now,
what is it you'll learn?
Precisely and only what is needed
to trust a clear picture of
what your life is. 
You will first learn
how to make a plan, a map of who you are,
and who you want to be.
You will exercise Part one of this book,
until you plan is good enough to be wrong,
and truthful enough to hurt.

This will be the beginning of change,
and the first test of your commitment.
Your performance is evaluated simply:
whether or not you end up 
eating, 
sleeping, 
thinking, 
talking, and 
acting differently.  

# Lesson in Roles 
## Think  

Think, student.
Do not take notes, 
simply pay attention. 
Everything I say is meant plainly. 
 If you get confused, forget it,
and pay attention to right now.

Our goal here is thinking. 
Thinking happens in your heads. 

Right now your job is to think
about the truth you see in what i say. 

A student has two roles to think in: Reader and Writer.

## READER   
A reader is a listener and observer.

Reading is the same as 
listening to me,
except the pace of my words
don't determine 
how fast you have to think,
or remind you to
PAY ATTENTION!

You'll get good at thinking, 
but not because of attention.
Your attention cannot be trusted
to be left alone while reading,
so we will take away distracting technology.
There will be no phone or internet access.

the simplest scientific instrument.
so the clock will babysit you.

your attention is not reliable, The clock is.
The clock is a cue to think.
 When it goes off,
get back on task.


Your goal in reading
is to isolate the truth from the lie. 
Try reading this sentence:
"Everyone is best off running weekly until they die."
You're thinking, "this can't be true for everyone, so it's a lie."
Not so fast. 

There are many components to this idea,
and likely many that you believe are truthful.
We'll get nowhere in an all-or-nothing philosophy class.
The most common delineation of truth and lie,
is a matter of changing
the pronouns in the writing.

In our example, consider this revision:
"I am best off running weekly until I die."
Now the author's words are consistent with your truth.

Doing this makes a clear relationship
between your belief and the author's.
Becoming smart is the discipline of
understanding how you relate to others.

When reading, you may only dismiss
writing where the author has convinced you 
they are intentionally lying.


Read to assess your BET on 
the WORDs reflecting TRUTH for 
1-the author. 
2-you. Ask yourself how you saw the world before,
and after reading. 
3-others. Ask if this generalizes to others.

Assign WEIGHTs (0 to 9) to what you read.
Whether to a book, sections, or a word.

I BET this is true for:

0 = not even the author.
1 = only the author. 
2 = the author and me (Us), but less than 30% of PPL.
3 = Us and 30% of PPL.
9 = Us and approx. 90% of the human population.




## WRITER  
How will your life look 
if you put it on paper?
Like a bunch of words.

How do you change it?
By deleting the words with lies,
and replacing them with better words. 

The right words will change 
your actions and your life.
To live a better life, 
starts with your words.

*push-writer*
In order to do something about thoughts, 
we need to think on paper. 
 [You'll write a lot.
You'll delete a lot.
You'll get good at writing.]
*epush*

BET on WORDs.
A writer invests time and energy 
to map feelings onto words. 

Good writing is discovering, 
curating, and applying insight. 
Bad WRITING has an author; *ad hominem* 

Revisions also make you a WRITER.
When you revise words (yours or others') 
to maximize your BET,
you are a writer.


Separate thought and self (author), 
by BETTING explicitly. 

State your assumptions, 
do not justify them. 
-is-STYLE-bad

Replace \"I am.\" with tag words.

Strive for COMM-CONTENT and brevity;
Write only valuable BETs, or
WORDs that manifest valuable BETs.
Prioritize understanding over original writing.

WRITING for LIB-PPL, 
relatable, depersonalized, objective words,
minimizes ROT, maximizes PLAN utility.

# Instructor  
I am instructor, 
a guardian of  
1. True IDEAs and
2. WRITER of a general PLAN (this book).

An instructor READS, and enforces 
BETs on LINKs toward a PLAN. 

My goals are to  
1. Minimize student effort and time to write.  
2. READ for 
cognitive biases,
illogical appeals, and
imprecise language, and
WRITE feedback that is
dispassionate and neutral, yet
invested and True.
3. Reward arguments based on 
(Truth:) REALITY, SELF, and VALUES. 
4. Reward IDEAS shared (vs kept).
