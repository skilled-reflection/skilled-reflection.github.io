## The Garden: PPL

*PPL*    
Think of the seeds of people 
that clarify and cultivate your garden. 

In someone else's garden, you have (only) what you see immediately  
before you, and their word about what came before.  
Maybe they are your friend, and he needs help with some unruly vines, or  
maybe you are captivated by some apples you haven't seen before.  
Everything that happens in their garden could be thought of as a seed in  
your garden: how much time your visit takes and what you're left with,  
after.  
  
Sometimes, people are like water, bringing extra life to needy crops.  
Sometimes people are careless and track weeds in on their boots, or  
over-encourage your interests until you sprain an ankle, or
come to your garden and  distract you, 
make you anxious or bored or excited. 
How are people affecting your garden?  
  
*NORMS*
Where do you get seeds from 
and how did you know to plant them? 
From  
other people, right? 
No silly, you don't know how to plant all these  
plants! 
Lucky for you, many of the most important crops, products, and  
savings are already grown, prepared and handed to you---in exchange for  
money, which you have from spending time on a much larger, collective  
garden called society, doing some very specialized thing called WORK.  
You'll do about 80,000 hours of work in your life in exchange for  
already grown apples and baked cake, and things like toilets to take  
your poop somewhere else.  
  
The expectation that you will WORK for money for goods 
is normal (NORMS).
NORMS may or may not always 
be the most reliable way for you.  

## PPL

### FORCE  

cause of change.   
There are forces within your control, and   
forces outside your control.   

MAINTENANCE is what it costs 
to neither move toward nor away from a GOAL.   
RISKS are covered by INSURANCE. 

### Norms
NORMS are the web of FORCES of   
all actions of all people, including   
WORK, religion, popular attitudes, and DOUBTS.   
  
NORMS benchmark the COST of living.  
NORMs pay out MONEY for WORK,
and can also negatively impact your GOALs.   

When you are individual, 
NORMS push against you
  
(PPL'S LANGUAGE is made from NORMS.)

### Work  
WORK is made to serve NORMs, not you.
yet takes 80k hours of your time.

WORK pays the broadest INSURANCE: MONEY.   
Money is traded for MAINTENANCE of  
SELF and VALUES.   

### RLTP 
GOALs about PPL.   
Good ones are aligned
with your VALUES,
Bad ones cost you.   
RLTPs are reciprocal BETS,   
yours of them, and vice versa.  

RLTPs, especially family members, 
coordinate many GOALS for SAVINGS.  

### ALIGN  

Adjust direction of your goal 
to be more similar to another force,
usually one acting against your goal.

## L7: Goals vs PPL   
  
"Student vs. School"  
**Task 1. 3m, 40w.**  
This is a lesson in curriculum writing.  
Imagine a perfect course exists,   
designed to teach you    
to fulfill your specific ambitions.   
  
What are your top 4 goals for  
the next 10 years?  
you could work on any part of yourself,   
move toward any goal you want.  
  
list four goals,  
Each no longer than 10 words  
  
**Task 2. 3m, 40w.**  
Your current program requires things your 10 year plan does not.   
Courses impose a number of  
conditions on your life:    
1.  Fixed time: courses  
2.  Variable time: assignments  
3.  Uncertain time: studying  
  
List four objectives, goals, course or program requirements that are  
most on your mind right now.   
Whether most frustrating, or most critical  
to you, even 'impress my professor'.  
  
**Task 3. 5m, 50w.**    
  
Spell out the intersection between the two lists.   
Think of how each goal in the second list  
directly influences (or not) your 10 year  
objectives.  
  
Explore the main ways these two lists relate.   
  
For example,    
1.  If I don't get a B, I won't keep my scholarship, and will have to  
    get a job which will likely lower all my grades.  
  
  
**Task 4. 15m, 100w.**    
  
  
What is the least you can do toward the course requirements and still achieve your long term goals?  
Consider cutting the work from list two,  
that doesn't overlap with one.  
  
Examples:  
  
1.  Graphic design is fun but not necessary. I could drop it and  
    still graduate.  
2.  If I get a D, I'll still pass, graduate, and be able to start my own  
    business.  
  
Add 100 more words to your description.  
  
**Task 5. 15m, 50w.**  
  
Negotiate ways to make direct progress on your first list while fulfilling the second list.  
  
For example, my personality class requires a term paper.   
To align with my business goal, maybe the professor will let me write  
on "personality traits of Entrepreneurs."  
  
Add up to 50 words, and revise.
