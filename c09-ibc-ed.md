# Section One: Education    

## pay attention  

### COMM-to Applicant    

How would your life look 
if you put it on paper?
How do you get what you
need and want? 
How do you clarify and 
direct your life? 

With better words. 
The right words will change 
your actions and your life.
It's time to live a better life. 
It starts with your words,
and a commitment to change.

Committing is a personal decision, and risk. 

1.Is there a better version of you?
2.Are you capable of moving toward it?
3.Are you ready?

### Attention: Be Here   
Now let me move your identity
from the ground to the sky.
Instead of a garden
your ambition is a star (point),
seen from the eyes of reality,
feet of progress underneath you.

Habit of strength needed
to take the right steps,
keen eyes to optimize course
focused mind to steady the foot.

#### Attention  
Do not take notes, 
simply pay attention. 
Everything is meant plainly. 
 If you get confused, forget it,
 recenter on (pay attention to) right now.

#### Thinking  
Our goal here is thinking. 
Thinking happens in your heads. 
In order to do something about it, 
we need to think on paper. 
 [You'll write a lot.
You'll delete a lot.
You'll get good at writing.]

#### Time  
  [You'll get good at thinking.
  but not because of attention]

your attention is not reliable. 
 The clock is.
The clock is a cue to think.
 When it goes off,
get back on task (pay attention).

#### Truth  
There is some truth inside 
some of you more than others. 

It is your job to    
focus on the Truth in you.
(It is my job to tell you 
 how shitty of a liar you have been.
)  
You will practice all this with 
Skilled Reflection. 

### READER   

listening to another person. 

Read to assess your BET on 
the WORDs reflecting TRUTH for 
1-the author. 
2-you. Ask yourself how you saw the world before,
and after reading. 
3-others. Ask if this generalizes to others.

Assign WEIGHTs (0 to 9) to what you read.
Whether to a book, sections, or a word.

I BET this is true for:

0 = not even the author.
1 = only the author. 
2 = the author and me (Us), but less than 30% of PPL.
3 = Us and 30% of PPL.
9 = Us and approx. 90% of the human population.

When reading,
Revise the pronouns as-written to align
with the corresponding bet above.
For example,
if you read the sentence,
"Everyone is best off running weekly until they die,"
and you bet the author might believe that
for himself, but
its not relevant for me or a lot of people,
then you may as well read the written sentence as
"I am best off running weekly until I die."
This is what you've chosen to believe,
given the text.
Admitting it allows you to grant that observation,
and the argument for doing this is
that it makes it easier for you to
give credit and opportunity to make an argument
where it is due,
and not simply ignore it
because the author didn't read your mind.

I share this because it seems to me
not only is the last point very common
amongst active readers,
almost increasingly so.



## IBC   
On the computer screen is a memo:
This is a boot camp 
whose purpose is to train adults 
to think harder, clearer and more effectively; 
to produce intelligent solutions 
for personal and social puzzles; 
to have a higher cognitive discipline; 
to instill shared values about 
reason, thinking and discourse; and 
to empower.

a training program designed to 
break down bad habits of thought,
amidst a culture of rational thinking
isolated from the outside world.

Here you will relentlessly confront
your ideas 
about the world, 
with instructors 
drilling intellectual skills
(writing essays, arguing for ideas, and
developing proposals for action). 

You would be trained to 
move toward your goals with focus,
even in the face of perceptual, physical, or emotional distractions. 
Over time, students could expect to cultivate 
a sharper focus on cognitive objectives, 
resilience to distractions and challenges.
If you graduate,
it will be with the ability 
to identify, develop, and communicate ideal critical,
rational arguments, 
positions or plans (orally or written) given the available knowledge, finite time, and resources at hand 
(reference material, teamwork).   

Students would also learn 
a code of behavior for
being a community leader;
collaborating or competing with
an idiosyncratic, irrational world.

The central requirement for applicants would be 
a commitment to better understand 
the self and world. 

# Section Two: Culture    

## Intro  


## Roles    


A role is a set of attitudes and actions.

### READER  
[See READER](c02-reader.md)

### WRITE    

BET on WORDs.
A writer invests time and energy 
to map feelings onto words. 

Good writing is discovering, 
curating, and applying insight. 
Bad WRITING has an author; *ad hominem* 

Revisions also make you a WRITER.
When you revise words (yours or others') 
to maximize your BET,
you are a writer.


Separate thought and self (author), 
by BETTING explicitly. 

State your assumptions, 
do not justify them. 
-is-STYLE-bad

Replace \"I am.\" with tag words.

Strive for COMM-CONTENT and brevity;
Write only valuable BETs, or
WORDs that manifest valuable BETs.
Prioritize understanding over original writing.

WRITING for LIB-PPL, 
relatable, depersonalized, objective words,
minimizes ROT, maximizes PLAN utility.

### PEERs    

Forget *who* provides REVISION and how much. 
Get answers from others.

### Student  

Students are PPL with
IDEAS from EXPERIENCE toward 
selfish GOALS. 

Lessons depend on 
students' prior knowledge. 

A STUDENT 

1.has a goal that can be better named and planned.
2.requires time away from BETTING.
3.admits not knowing but capable.

Students learn
to represent their knowledge in words;
to prefer better, alternative words.
A student
sees the impersonal as more reliable 
both for selfish GOALS and
social ones. 

A bad student studies 
to avoid action, or 
for its own sake.

A Student WRITES IDEAs and GOALs
to their INSTRUCTOR.

### Instructor    
A guardian of 
1.True IDEAs expressed in COMM, and
2.WRITER of a general PLAN (this book).

An instructor READS, and enforces 
BETs on LINKs toward a PLAN. 

1.Minimize student effort and time to write. 
2.READ for 
 - cognitive biases,
- illogical appeals, and
- imprecise language, and
 WRITE feedback that is
  - dispassionate and neutral, yet
- invested and True.
3.Reward defense of arguments based on 
(Truth:) REALITY, SELF, and VALUES. 
4.Reward IDEAS shared (vs personal).

### RLTP--Peers  

Peer review is a powerful learning tool.

The peer WRITER 
works with uncompromised objectivity, 
and liberty to employ Truth, 
however subjectively "harsh".

### Scientist    

A scientist WORKs to win BETS against the UNKNOWN. 
They are a professional writer, 
evaluated on two metrics:

1.For their MEMES of CONTENT.
2.The net benefit of their MEMES on GOAL outcomes.

A scientist-researcher is a WRITER, 
a data-collector and hypothesis tester. 
A scientist-scholar is a READER,
curating toward theory development and COMM.

### Scholar    

a professional READER and 
Peer-Reviewer,
especially in curating the Scientist's insights.

evaluated by repost statistics 
(others as readers),  
akin to evaluating twitter users by their retweets.




### Agreement  
On acceptance you will attend 
an in-person immersive experience.

Our bodies resist discomfort. 
You won't learn
unless you cannot escape needing it;
in a dedicated environment 
that fosters acquisition,
minimizes interference.

7- or 30-day experience,
meals and lodging included.
There will be no phone or internet access.

In exchange, students are to
0.provide two minutes of product
 for every minute of learning.
a.content toward others' learning (IBC).
b.the application of their learning.

Dedicate to identity growth. 
Be:

1.Quiet, except when tasks require verbal response.
2.Receptive to work and feedback provided by the instructor.
3.Committed to producing genuinely inspired ideas, working quickly,
and seeking improvement.
4.Respectful that all are equal in voice, and aim to describe
solutions with collective values.
5.Receptive and responsive to prompts and observations (from peers and/or
 instructors)
  especially CHUD, vague language, and cognitive bias.
6.Motivated to describe solutions that benefit others, when possible, including peer-review

As a result the student will
- eat, sleep, think, talk, and act differently.

Now,
what is it you'll learn?
The first subject is
to gain a clear picture of
what you think your life is. 



## manifesto  

If you an informed STUDENT,
then you will arrive at the following
principles of knowledge, language, and action.

### better language / world  

Distrust words and ego.
- Take nothing personally
- Define everything empirically
  - comparison group/quantity (has unique outcome)
- Remove / ignore style
- Speak for reasons only
- Idea > authorship (anonymity)
- Read to refine beliefs and doubts.
- Write to bet.

#### speak   
Speak, write, initiate or respond only

in limited duration and words
dictated by intended outcome.

Do not at all
when actions or listening 
are needed.

#### listen  
listen / read
be with

when you need to learn / connect
- limited in duration/words needed
- to assess consent (agreement).

not when
- speaking values unadhered

#### repair  
when listening to invalid speech,
after--repair
1m-gently with gestures
2m-briefly and clearly with words
3m-firmly with boundaries
5m-take polite action to end conversation

#### dialog / revise / anon  
write what you bet
revise toward truth
- to max others' bets

radical anti-ownership of ideas
- edit for anyone with the authority of your autobiography
- for the benefit of the OP
- expecting only feedback

### actions  
commit values to bets
- self + calling > cakes
- idea > xref
- bet > fact > belief > word
- action > money > words > thoughts

solutions to problems
- remove problem src or self from problem.
- accept that problem comes from other solutions
- revise those solutions (ie reuse)
- blitz solution
- eat, sleep better
- wake up: cold shower, pint of water, work out, deaf/blind hour, spend time with an ugly person

minimalism; align, revise and keep fit
- keep only hf things in smallest box possible
- keep clean
- keep routine (self) needs minimal
  - stuff, expectations, plans (movement)

### actions  
"if" requires an action argument.
- (tethering hypotheticals)
