g-sit long without backpain
0-back pain vs-relief depends on back alignment vs-mis
1-sit on the edge of a bed
2-adjust posture however you like
3-how long can you sit
  - why cant you fix

bc you are not consciously aware of what it takes,
bc you have not consciously achieved better posture

it means posture, as good as it gets for you, has been an unconscious, mediocre accomplishment.

usecase
i have sat on a bed edge typing
my mistake seems to be over-correcting,
- pronating my lower back
- rolling my pelvis far too forward
i think the best posture
which i unconsciously slip from
is to elongate my lower back vertically
- pressing my sits bones into the bed and elevating the back of my head as far as possible, directly over it, lifting my ribcage with my breath to feel this stack.
once achieved, i incrementally relax  my muscles from top to bottom,
shoulders, ribs, gut.
